petr thanks for the fedback a couple of coments for proposal 2 note that i mentioned the deserialize cal would return an instance of the clas this might not the most ideal thing to do for this method though for proposal 1 i do not think there is actualy a problem you can create an empy object with a dumy name and then have the deserialize method overwrite it clas a object def init self name self name name def deserialize self o self dict o obj a test obj deserialize name new name obj name new name i understand the point behind pasing the flag is to validate that either of those are set but i personaly do not se a huge value in that for this specific case one reason i prefer 2 is because it would avoid creating an instance of the object with dumy none data,0

you realy think that technical criteria is much more practical and les controversial this statement clearly shows you have not ben involved in neutron and openstack long enough to realize otherwise p why are people so concerned about the hoping efect to me it is a non isue people tend to stick around for a few years that is what it takes to understand the ful openstack machinery if they do not most likely what they produce is not gona work or rot quickly that is openstack way of life now this is not about core vs non core so please let us stop raising this point,0

yes unfortunately this does ad some fragility here though you are wrong that it is inserting namespace data and of course if the compiler does ad that it would make for a 10 failure rate of the test fun fact func aparently at least on the android build system is resolved to prety function which does ad a lot of crap as per the comend on the hardcoded strings though this way we are ensuring we have to corect maping and do not require constants for everything that is redundant and makes it harder to ad tests again this is a test not another abstraction layer on top of a hal on top of an api,1

one way to make exploitation harder even if there is no guard page would be to ad weak secondary stack aslr in bionic the problem with that is it can screw over calers with very precisely sized stacks as they wil have les available than they expect using a single page for aslr with stacks 1m is arguably sane because they could be screwed over by a compiler update if they are that close to the end i have a patch doing this but it is prety sketchy so i did not have plans to upstream it,1

fwiw i uploaded a fix for build qemu android sh here,0
even though this solution is aceptable it is stil not clear to me the diference in behavior betwen this aproach and raising shareresourcenotfound given the code below if you always throw shareresourcenotfound no if else condition as in your code manager wil do exactly what you are doing it wil swalow the exception and proced if it is not deleting path as you are checking for such in share status it wil throw exception just as are you doing since manager is only swalowing the exception when deleting the share the only scenario which i think this is valid is if this library is used outside of manila which is what i understod based on our irc conversation but by using share status here i am asuming it wil not be used outside of manila manager code path so i am stil confused as why always throwing shareresourcenotfound does not achieve the same behavior as you are implementing in your driver code please corect me if i am mising something,0

this does not capture distinguish the case where sh fails becausethe host crashes during the update you should be able to catch thatcase with code like this result e args 1 if result exit status 25 this is an sh failure not an update engine failure,0
this is not a right place for a panic when a diferent method of eror handling would do the job i e returning an er real library functions should avoid panic,0

this block belongs in stop opendaylight the bits in unstack sh go here,0
why the hel we ned a copy,1
this is entirely stupid but if one subclased this and pased in aditional apis you would be overwriting them here i am not gona wory about it,0
if we do not expose the mode then we wil be using a mode that the user canot find out about with xrandr or whatever that sems bad to me otoh i do have sympathy for stephane s point,0
the ultimate bikesheding the semi colon is useles,0
maybe a dumb question but get bot device wil cal client list bot devices if drac bot devices is none so why bother doing this here instead of leting it be done in get bot device,0

btw why not just myfakescenario do it preprocesors preprocesors,0
ken ichi the policy checks already was used in api layer it is my fault i wil update this thanks very much,0
this should be group solum core without the project here is a god example,0
i asume this requires to ad standard atr id in migration,0
wtf,1
why datanode this template contain slave proces,0
useles now,0
why is regexp quote necesary here why not just metering secret metering secret,0
no let us just remove this nonsense comand in another patch,0
nit beter move inside trans,0
btw i suspect this might fail on extn because of the non zero exit code and the set e comand why do not you change this to something like if stat f c t squashfs then,0
okey i wil use your regexp,0
nit i would sugest that exposing the zlib return values here is overkil the client of such a function is only concerned about uncompresing the whole file otherwise it would be using the gzx functions directly so just make it return a bolean true for suces false for failure,0
ah this should be ignore mising ignore mising,0
start sh is what we want to execute cmd here not the python script,0
your ordering is a litle ugly bug and test should be above al the tags an the change id should be together with al the signed of bys then maybe i would have noticed that git hash the first time i loked at this,1
this is kind of ugly i think instead you should pas the timeout with the function when you register it and kep a private max timeout requested variable,1
hm does the end person want to know what state it was trying to be set to when it failed nostate sems somewhat useles,0
unique constraints or indexes on nulable columns are absolutely stupid anyway i fuly suport geting rid of these cases in the db schema,1

use cal false wil be removed in the next ps,0
also explain in this file why the compiler was failing and dx s smart dumb behavior,1
let us just kil first bot d at this point i prefer o r c scripts that manage their own idempotency removes the last usage of it,0
why pul this out into quasi globals when you just set it the same in al thre vms below or is this al because the overload of the run list clears the run list using the old way,0
what i would do here inside of instaling mysql directly is just cal nodepol mysql from pupet openstackci,0
hasmodifierswithmodifiersmodifiedismodified everything i can think of sems to be worse for now,0
it is where keystoneclient stores the signing junk sems like it is not playing nicely when it is not the same as nova there could be some devstack juju we do not know about,0
pkg list is a string you want list packages instead and delete line 671,0
please remove white spaces at the begining of the line,0
long line wc shows 91 chars you probably ned to set line length warnings in vim emacs,0
i realy should learn how to sort in vi for when i am doing stuf over sh clearly i am to stupid to do it manualy,0
i had comented on that before sems a litle sily,0
let us get rid of the extra white space here,0
drop the die,0
can you reword this a litle also the bug report itself is a litle confusing,0
replication partners should not be hardcoded here,0
interesting that kinda suck but i gues as long as this works for now,1
is the code catching typeror just in case pid none it would read beter if you just said this up front then some of this code could be cleaned up if pid and self rot helper child pid none while true try child pid utils find child pids pid 0 except indexeror last proces in the tre return it return child pid,0
remove the black space,0
garbage colected,0
unfortunately i had to do al of that casting or ansible converted back to unicode i agre very ugly,1

stupid nit could you please ad a longer description of why we are removing this,0
this backslash is not required and should go away,0
because i am an idiot fixing now god catch,0
you haven t initialized run at load what s it is value here are you sure,0
runing d as rot alows about a bilion compromises so this should be tightened at some point being able to tighten being the whole point of rotwrap geting the tightening right is damn hard though so should probably be a separate bug,1
it is posible that profile exists but dodisplaynotification has not ben caled so notification id is stil in pending notifications we should just check if the notification is in pending notifications and erase it return in that case,0
oh damn it now i get it yeah that makes sense ignore my coment,1
remove does always remove from the head of the fre list,0
stupid spel check acoring should be acording,0
what if the directory does not exist localy wil this be created if so i wonder if subsequent stack sh may end up screw up permisions if not since this is suposed to be owned by the stack user,1
lazy boy you could write ceilometer conf entirely,1
i get why this is neded i was just hoping to have kiled the cli tests by now,0
i was thinking exactly the same this was taken from another driver but it sems sily,1
let us move the bad mac check into wifi data provider mac since we are prety sure it is a mac only isue then we can ad a dcheck here to make sure we are geting valid data on al platforms that way if we run into the same isue on another platform we wil find out about it instead of silently droping the wifi data,0
no action required validating behavior lovely canot wait for you to replace this crap with their functional beters,1
i think here you should use just for uid in uid list,0
anal but i can mention it may be used by third party packages,1
pathetic my bad,0
kil,0
1 last part should hapen in finaly block to restore file contents even if pupet failed 2 you should restore file contents not dump new yaml into it you wil lose al coments and prety formating from user pov 3 if safe dump fails for some reason file wil end up empty use our atomic file updating aproach,0
actualy sean you are not exactly corect to this mesage is meant to be read by api consumers references to internal functions are kind of useles to developers of client aps and operators the right mesage would probably simply be mac adres canot be nul and mac adres x contains whitespaces the text mac adres can be pased as a parameter to validate no whitepsace,0
i think we should talk a bit about this one it could make for some realy nasty output on devstack also my devstack logs are already murdering my system,0
again kil this,0
this could be just return verify result line 970 971 is useles,0
these acesors are not neded as you are using alrenderprocesmeasurementsarecurentfortesting now,0
do we ned this it is already set as the layoutmanager seting the span count on it should probably propagate by itself,0
sems this change is useles resource names makes a cal to self count inside,0
sems like it can always be a token acquired by a trust id asociated with a user who created the triger,0
dumb question where is this new mnoutlinelevel variable ever used,0

that coment is completely useles this whole file is about xls xlsx export,0
i am not so sure this flush work maters there is no lock around the entire lut so this flush work just protects against a partial update of a single lut entry and a single lut entry is probably atomic since it is just a u32,0
a runing instance or a stoped instance can a stoped instance be reboted asking the dumb questions so we make this as readable as posible,0
mising partial bug 1541928,0
ops what the hel mysql drop user test localhost eror 1396 hy0 operation drop user failed for test localhost so i had user test but as long as we create these users and generate random names for them we should be fine with this stupid mysql it sems that there is no easy way to drop a user only if it exists,1
damn i meant to and then i forgot,1

json dump f discovered data,0
you are breaking botstrap admin node sh script logic when deleting this line,0
you kiled the magic query why,0
nit alignment here is of project id should be lined up with nova fixtures above,0
i do not se these hapening in my testing of this i may be doing it wrong so i wil kep my 1 until i realize i am an idiot or it is not working,0
typo genenv sh,0
not your fault but i think that this flag should have instead ben named acpi ac and made to default to being on then boards like this one could unset it in their overlays,0
are you mising htprety activate to monkey patch sockets,0
typo in comit mesage which test should be executed when ran within multiusertestcase,0
if you are fixing nits anyway s a,0
kprimnot 0 as above,0
barbican is only incubated and potential graduation is something we should not bank on entirely i would realy like to se a dumb key alocator done just in nova for the instances as a falback even though it is not 10 secure it would handle the at rest problem of another user boting their guest and doing strings on dev sda1 to pul out previous user data this is something which has previously ben exploited at amazon rax and digitial ocean so definitely worth protecting against even before barbican becomes a ful part of openstack,0
nit this check is testing what the fuck vector is initialized empty which is not neded here,0
just for readability but it does lok a bit sily now,1
any reasons for not using decorators or context managers here it is strange you do not stop these mocks,1

please also remove these mixins i do not se how they are useful,0
comented out code should be removed,0
damned if you do damned if you do not i m doing it because i have goten nits about it i do the same as you are sugesting in other code bases,1
nit data get with subnet would work just fine since none is a false value,0
i might be being stupid but i realy do not se the purpose of the self remaining here,0
you do not ned these separate vars just use the side efect inline with the nested context mocks below,0
what tols i only se start stop daemon being used in this script,0
i think this tempurl should be removed like below,0
check gateway in subnet should be a clasmethod in order to use cls check subnet ip instead of neutrondbpluginv2 check subnet ip,0
again this coment should be removed or we should have two sections like above,0
wow that is realy stinky thanks lucas,0
output formating is kind of ugly right now yeah,1
please get rid of this function,0
so in comparing with the other pupet jobs we should create the bundled gems dir and switch to a similar patern for the instalation and runing of bundler mkdir bundled gems export gem home pwd bundled gems gem instal bundler no rdoc no ri verbose gem home bin bundle instal retry 3 gem home bin bundle exec rake lint gem home bin bundle exec rake validate gem home bin bundle exec rake spec also do we want to go back to a template to at least check pupet 3 x and pupet 4 x,0
init py now should be empty,0
sesionmanager is a chrmoes only component this block neds to be os chromeos only if automationmanageraura is used on other platforms,0

eliminate backslash here and later in file,0
delete the die,0
comented line do we ned another fixme or should this be removed,0
was going to ask why you did not do this as a query string parameter then i realized i was being dumb because nobody in their right mind should do a delete of a get method so yes this a handy trick,0
you mean after executing the template it is not trivial since n are significant inside code snipets i failed to understand how to force text template to emit corect spaces i tried and and various combinations of thereof this shit is insane i gave up,1
hm actualy this is not a stdlib it should be inserted at line 25 please check other six imports to,0
stupid trailing space,1
the downside of taking these guides out of the openstack manuals no easy way to reference other files i wil yank out this link,0
we are kiling al enum tests so do not ad this one n,0
this adapter is very ineficient you should not be creating a new view everytime reuse the convertview whenever posible also the last parameter is wrong you ned to suply the parent view to the inflater minflater inflate parent false,0
the only reason to do this is that we have aps whose heap dump exceds 270m the max buf size has to be atleast twice the size of the heapdump,0
format requires and not around emails i know it suck,1
inconsistent with devstack se stack sh for definitive style xen scripts are a mes,0
i se why you did it this way in just a straight removal of the tuskar stuf but it loks gofy outside of that context can we just use template name instead of this local var,0
this line should be params params,0
can you ad checks here and below a malformed elf could have a huge sh size that causes this to fail,0
ops sily editor fixed localy and wil be in the next revision asuming there is one,1
it is coming from iterating the edges member which is a what the fuck vector,0
several e12 checks are wrong and contradict pep8 we should ignore them,0

daniel do you have a tracking bug for this that i could reference here or would crbug com 78318 cover this as wel,0
ok i se what you are saying so i aded a check le not just for overal defensive coding but also since these apis are kind of peculiar in the first place i e the cb ch args are so weird what if i screwed them up or what if i pas one size and check against a diferent size friendly joke now that i understand your thinking i fuly expect you to 1 find al cals to open and make sure they check for fds 1 2 find al cals to read and ad a check le in case it overan the bufer,1

remove the network id from the network ports list,0
does not this just mean we fucked up the mips syscal s in bionic the other architectures move the syscal number into the apropriate register and then make that system cal directly on mips we actualy use a syscal system cal i do not think that is necesary and we should just fix the mips syscal s in bionic is nr syscal even implemented i canot find it in the kernel source,1
damit god catch done,1
mock it the same way you mock set service state,0

the host does not have to handle the rolover the host side is prety dumb it just compares the sample id before and after reading data if they match then the host is hapy,0
liar,1
that is a god point arguably minijail does alow you to fuck some things up but not many you can always pas a ful capabilities mask for example if you want to draft a version of this cl that delays the elf linkage check that is fine if you want to land this to unblock other work that is ok,1
test show quotas subproject,0
ok my concern is that would impact a lot more code and status is notorious for being kind of garbage on some services which is part of the systemd win that we wil get on ubuntu in the next lts and be able to dump al these work arounds,0
this aproach should cover your example because user wil get a 404 and that should also cover other cases e g network problem betwen glance and the backend store which the user should not know care about it does not 404 was just an example it can be anything another example me upload image glance notfound image url failed fetch returned any htp status that you can think about me oh shit my url is not working because me upload image uri like i said if we agre that reason does not contain any security isue then why hide it at al if it is not meant for the user special case faulty switch so be it if it is user problem that a big win,1
this die is not neded emake wil already abort,0

it is comon to use kwargs instead of kwds,0
i think we wil ned names for this and the other fk below,0

these two are unecesary for realoc so you can put them under ifdef guard blocks,0
u kiled u kiled,0
you mean here and on lines 60 and 62 those exception are just to verify that this fixup works and i ned jenkins to fail to se either one of those mesages and nothing fails damn heisenbug,1
let us also unset handle to so that if we eroneously end up being caled twice we do not try to kil the already kiled proces or even worse trying to kil some newly started proces that reused our pid,0
yes we can lol smacks head that piece of code is deserving to be on those 10 worst pieces of code ever lists,0
i hate to be anal but should not the equals be extended a litle farther out to match the number of characters in federation,1
please learn a litle of english language before using on top of that please learn a litle of python before comiting the patches overal this docstring is bad and you should fel bad learning why this is a bad docstring is left for you as an exercise,0

noqa is not neded here,0
another unprintable char at the end,0

recomend changing stucked stuck,0
should be used jsonutils from lib oslo serialization,0
just a style note this is realy ugly indentation also is there a reason you could not use the decorator mocks and avoid the nesting,1
only router id should be conflicted with ids to ignore i mean if we have only router id the ids to ignore should always be none,0
i get the meaning of frozen but why not the neutron plugins hyperv model py file is being removed so those tables represent false data also it is consumers hypervneutronplugin wil be removed so it wil just be dead code,0

public endpoint and admin endpoint ned to be configurable,0
if does not work at al 1 it would be col to raise to indicate it to the user rather than disabling debug in his back 2 i think you are just changing the default not the actual value so you might stil run the ap with debug enabled and workers 1,0
this version neds to be incremented se the number after rebase,0
mark sory but i am not completely understanding why the fact that testing with an instance object does not mater here to just dumb this down for my own sake are you saying that once i change conductor manager compute stop to handle instance as a dict instead of object this test becomes useful,0

not sure what the best way here is 1 let it leak it wil eventualy finish 2 terminate it dead that is what i did here 3 send wm close window may prompt the user for confirmation we do not realy want that the use case here is things like doing some background network pinging etc user has no idea what is runing console aps sem to not do what you expect here the default behaviour wil kil the console window without afecting the main proces of the ap if you wanted to act on a failed atempt with a heavy handed terminateproces you ned to block even longer or delay stuf on the event lop we do not want to do either here 4 generateconsolectrlevent you canot control the proces group this signal is sent to it goes to everybody in the caling proces group that is bad very bad i gues the only intended use case is when a dying proces wants to warn it is children i could use 4 if i launched a subproces inside a proces group that then launched the comand that sems wasteful and we bit non trivial,0
that was dumb but i gues it is not the first time i have ben of by an order of magnitude thanks for your patience and for explaining,0
is there any ned to mention that deleted resources count towards the quota limit it is a tribal knowledge and may not be obvious to api users,0
try not to leave comented out code in particular this wil because a crash in tests in l140 when use real clients false so it is beter to just create the real one unconditionaly and leave the todo,0
just a litle sugestion when i have internal test methods like this that have a lot of mocks decorating them i tend to indicate that a particular mock is not actualy aserted against or used in the test by prefixing the name of the mock with a in the mock decorators above mock create mock create bdm mock validate bdm and mock ensure default are al in this category it just makes it slightly easier for the reviewer to scan which mocks should have coresponding asertions in the folowing code,0
you proper english people and al your extra u s,0
stupid dyslexia hides these fixed now,1
maybe ad a link to the bug here to motivate this change otherwise i wory we wil be back in a year removing this obviously stupid code and did you want to 1 here rather than everywhere you use it,1

expect false isvisible keyboard here and below,0
same this should be baked into the tre during init with the same union logic,0
i am realy dumb in this regard so please bear with me but why is it ml2 is binding an ml2 only thing that is not present for other plugins should we then think about how we decouple it from the port,0
can we come up with a beter name for this i created the original name bc i suck with naming one probably awful name i came up with is get networking state,1

hm right then the deleted at column should be set to timeutils utcnow whenever you mark something as deleted otherwise this field is useles,0
this is the intersection of the lists also it is worked out at o n n which suck you ned the set diference some optimisation posible here either by working them out simultaneously or extracting both to a helper function which fels more right,1
remove this bol section sine you have optional turned on,0
nit i think it would be clearer to use al targets inlined and one target inlinedinstead ofone target not inlined and ont target inlined,0
or alternatively obj setdeletable false if you just use a bolean field instead,0
should not this be self asembly id asembly uid,0
use ha queues if you change this option you must wipe the x database,0
masive slap on the wrist why are you inheriting from the neutrondbpluginv2 plugin i can understand why but you are beter of just duplicating the logic or rewriting the logic yourself,0

oh thank godnes for this change yay for removing useles log mesages,0
2 things 1 is it posible to unpause a machine which is runing i would think that you can only unpause something that is paused hiden bug why unpausing is being saved to the db if the curent state is runing 2 i think that for un pausing we should take a diferent aproach than this at this point the real state of the instance is unknown right we do not know whether the instance was paused or not but we already know the desired state and the curent state why we just do not automate that if before n cpu crashed the user requested to pause that instance and i asume that the api have returned saying that the requested was acept why we do not re isue the un pause instance request here i mean users would be like fuck yeah automation instead of just cleaning up the states leaving the machine in an unknown state and having the user to reisue the request to un pause the machine again and sory if someone already sugested that i have not loked in al previous patch sets to se if that is the case,1
i think there can be other options explored this is obviously the easier one but the one that wil yield the least amount of result at least in the short term what about spining of api db and go the bold way spoiler alert crazy guy talking what if we change the architecture completely and introduce a neutron api server we introduce neutron conductor perhaps a scheduler and have the rest of the server ie the plugin be it is own worker s just like nova compute is i gues we could do this as a folow up step so do not mind the crazy guy who makes a fol of himself,0
does it makes sense to ad networking fo wil also use this lib or it is to anal,1

hate to be a code natzi but spaces around the to match kernel style other than that loks fine,0
why do we ned to mock this i think you should mock update provider location,0

it was my understanding that mocking the cal to get bridges in the setup function wil result in it being mocked in al tests in this clas as the setup function is invoke before each test is run any mocked functions object would cascade into be mocked in each of the test sory if my first coment was unclear this would normaly be true however as the mocks are defined in a with contextlib nested block you are corect it wil not cascade as the scope of the mock is limited to the contextlib block i wil resubmit the updated patch shortly with this change,0

this init is redundant remove,0
this never apears to be used below do you ned to include the pupet cgit clas somewhere,0
use putlong instead of putstring long then no ned to convert to a string below,0
i chated with dale he is on board with moving lines 279 282 to fmpeg demuxer tests can you take that on it sounds like you have created a new chanel for the decoder to inform the demuxer of a config change if so one thing to be aware of asuming you are stil using our decoder stream is that signaling kconfigchanged from the demuxer wil result in a flush of the decoder many config changes actualy require a diferent decoder so this makes sense but in your case this is probably wasteful for videos that change size mid way through we just signal the new size to the uper layers and avoid the heavy decoder flush,0
organize this into a bulet list by prefixing with,0
put above dump for organization,1
maybe i am having a brain fart but if d is in network l168 how would you get a keyeror instead of l167 173 could do trimed network dict k v for k v in network iteritems if k not in status subnets nets apend trimed network,1
i hope you make this coment after having read the q a question otherwise i am gona have to go back and make sure we are crystal clear technical asesment is hard it requires intimate knowledge of the project under scrutiny it is dificult to agre on and imposes a policing burden that no one is prepared to take as busy as we are people overlap is the next best thing asumed that we trust the technical judgment of the people we work with having established a longstanding relationship with them sure people can move on if the project has not reached critical mas and it rots it is fair to remove unles someone else is prepared to step in and kep it alive and wel it is just the nature of the proverbial bus efect,0
this clas is now useles removed in a recent patch,0
termie would have burned me in hel but you are to nice so i wil update,1
please ad a space in the end,0
what confuses me is why the hel we do this std max here originaly,1
is it posible to benchmark the creation time for each of these iterators or is there an internal icu cache that wil make measurements useles,0
yeah it was prety dumb it could be improved but i figured the new aproach is more elegant anyway,1
done i wil leave the other 160 cases of iteritems in neutron to a future change however,0
not sure stack sh goes for this style they do one life if then i think,0
are not we loging a warning now with the latest patchset,0
whole restore cmd should be splited into thre groups and executed one by one for the beter eror handling pre backup run backup post packup there are separated methods in base backupruner clas,0
is it beter to ad parentheses here qe neutronclientexception,0
if we remove this condition is not router dashboard displayed by default configuration at now router dashboard is specific to cisco neutron plugin and it is not useful for many users dashboards are now plugable but the default configuration is stil important let me confirm sory if i am wrong,0
nit as there is only one test case here you could put this inside of test string to long method,0
seriously systemd does not replace sbin init anyway just a wtf from a hopefuly former systemd hater,1
what if there is no match what i meant was the worst case,0
this was not even a discriminated union ugh clearly c programers at work,0
do we do this in other elements the problem with this logic is that only rot wil have write aces to usr lib python so if you run the script as not rot you end up having to do the heavy lifting that is cached for you in a pyc pyo,0
multi line docstrings should start without a leading new line should start with weighers that weigh hosts by volume number in backends,0
discovery should be an extension api get os federated providers,0
there is only a single caler of this in parseasignmentexpresion and i am having trouble understanding how this if statement could ever execute could this be a dcheck instead,0
because i want to ensure that the comparison is done right before the cmov this also let us the hif go dead using dce,0
whats the diference betwen hosts review o o and hosts review o o git0 could not this break down into hosts git0 and hosts git0,0
remove self from here,0
here and elsewhere the c 14 trick requires you to write std enable if t with emphasis on the t it s a type alias for the type member of what you have writen here failing to do that wil mean sfinae wil silently alow invalid conversions aside might not be the worst idea to static aserts using std is constructible or no compile tests for some conversions you expect to be invalid,0
useles blank,0
driver number self path regex match disk path,0
yes you are right useles to go through al pol bindings,0
sory i mised this coment earlier i have run this several times and have not run into that but that does not mean it is not an isue maybe you could pastebin your failing pupet run,0
dict should be removed,0
should be using le instead of,0
if that damn start thread atribute goes away then this makes sense it wil always be a thread but if it can sometimes not be a thread then it does not sem like it should inherit from threading thread if that start thread is going to be removed anyway then i am fine with it for now if it is a short term thing anyways,1
i think the above rule are useles,0
hi sory for the stupid question but how come we do not have a name for this initfunction like the others eg horizon d3piechart init function,0
what are you pasing for the usim ef adn or the actual efid of the usim,0
this coment is useles it is my mistake,0
this blank line should be eliminated,0
sure however this slot canot be arbitrarily reused since the key enums must be sequential,0
the hardcoded value it is checking for threw me of tok me a second to figure out instead extend fakehtpconection overide request and always return your malformed body then put your test method into a new unitest testcase that sets up self midleware htp client clas as your extended fakehtpconection clas,0
must be dev sh sh host key to match shd config,0
if we do not exchange ice candidates is not remaining new forever corect i would expect al transports to be new,0
kvm pid path kvm pid,0
kil this line altogether once you make the return below a tail cal,0
yes as folow up patch i believe this is devtest sh default btw leaving these out stack create fails on timeout so we should start with filing a bug to tripleo first,0
kil this entirely,0
this is nonsense just say ldap also below just use the later expresion,0
it is stil not clear to me that the instance value here is going to be procesed by the oslo loging code and the uid wil be put into the log mesage i tried doing something like this in a python shel with a stdout handler but it was not working corectly loking at the oslo loging code was not any clearer the proces method there is loking for instance and instance uid in kwargs i am admitedly a n0b when it comes to the weird and wacky world of loging,1
i think you can use the two param version of asertequals if the tolerance is zero,0
short suport semi mt bol short is buton pad bol,0
done greg and rob had a lot of discusion on whether it should be nul terminator or string terminator let us use nul string terminator something sugested by rob here to make everyone hapy,0
include d textencoding is in what the fuck not in blink,1
devstack has a instal package function which should be used instead of directly caling apt get,0
i think die is apropriate here,0
can we move the macro to platform wtf asertions h,0
you should select lvm over iscsi option,0
and here you could use ps ewlo pid lwp com,0

this eror would go away per above,0

ok let us give this sample default idea a shot i319d128a0a8b197d8e2be105681f2b56240439,0
useles var,0
this wil be kiled in dependency once you rebase,0
meh inded sory sily coment,0
ah damn eclipse,1
yeah i figured out what you were doing se above i would not consider this comon this sems like a nasty way to do it imho opts n value 0x1 is cleaner and only requires 1 instruction versus 2 instructions,0
you are totaly right that was dumb of me not to catch fixed,0
yeah you are right i dug into this a bit and came up with a workaround for the loader lock being held using ntcreatethreadex with the don t send atach notifications flag i am not sure if is geting to ugly or not wdy alt,1
when do you get a name nul probably ad a coment about that,0
i hate the coment in the midle of a clas instantiation here fyi,1
bgp speaker id should be bgpspeakernetworkbinding bgp speaker id and network id should bgpspeakernetworkbinding network id,0
are we stil recomending that it is prety ugly backslash is easier to read imho,1
probably a dumb question but what is the 10 for,0
yes that is true i only glanced at the first search result for posix mount when checking the original submision and they used mount point for the name of the first parameter my stupidity the problem is that this is not unit testable because of the restrictions of the cpuinfo source,0
i think the way it is is marginaly more eficient because this check is not neded in case shit is above 31,1
that is awfuly pedantic it probably is les performant than the simple regex i wil do it anyway but your anti perl bias is kind of sily imo,1
self zonemanager lokup service fczm utils create lokup service,0
os kil,0
mox should be down a section,0
mesages here are used internaly by stdlib because skylark is dumb and i wanted structured values,1
should not this block be in an extend start sh,0
lame i wil clean this up,1
yeah gros,0
should there be either of the arguments u force reinstal,0
compute and asign os path join upstream pkgdir to a var rather than redundancies here sounds stupid minor but having it in one spot makes it harder to mis updating it,1
self f should be self test file,0
i do not quite get why we let the provisional navigation to hapen what if we had one prior to executing js url should we clear that one at least,0
you are pasing up probably your only oportunity to use the comit mesage kil kil,0
noqa should be removed,0
if we have got nothing die nothing god wil hapen,0
i am not sure about this i think we ned to folow the existing style most of factory tests includiung factory touchpad here have imports on separate lines maybe tamo can confirm,0
harnes py 231 cals this method indirectly cage service object api rule change rule parsed rule policy id rule policy name,0
yeah this is nice it wil have les trafic returned from neutron consider params tenant id context project id fields id that wil save you a few extra cycles once again i think that this code should be droped as it does not realy solve the isue when there is realy a race,0
this sems rather dangerous to me actualy if we start expecting that the display name that we give to the instance is in dns and we do not fail the operation if we canot satisfy that then users have the potential to do insecure things without realizing for example nova bot fo sh u myuser fo provider com acept host key y sh pasword for myuser fo provider com permision denied sh pasword for myuser fo provider com and thus i have just given my pasword to someone who guesed the hostname that i wanted unles we expose the actual hostname back to the nova user somehow we canot realy blame someone for comiting the above ofense imho which is prety bad,0
one posible way to find the nova network name is to execute the nova list comand the output wil list al openstack instances for the tenant including nework information lok for network name ip adres,0
can we also clarify what exactly we are fixing,0
likely a stupid concern on my part but since this is acesing the portre dbapi we are positive this wil not afect remote prebuilts that have not yet ben downloaded,0
clean up the useles whitespace in here,0
mtf mtf,0
this is a bad idea because you wil end up having to deal with escaping later why do not you just fil a std vector std string here and pas it through,0
i think updating kilprocesgroup right now is ok do not take a signal hardcode sigkil usie kil directly handle the pid 0 check up top cal updatepid 0 directlythen if when kil gets refactored to be sane this could be cut over to that,0
i did not want to clash with an existing field member sems to be used already in the unit tests i intentionaly went as ugly as posible,1
we can get rid of this function with a simple change to asert onlink subnet routes,0
done caled dalvik vm libi also then removed the ading in each runtime lib default mk to product property overides and just did it in one place in product config mk like this product property overides persist sys dalvik vm lib dalvik vm lib that sems beter right,0
dumb question this is pointing to the old rev since this is xcode s version and we canot go beyond what is instaled,0
done remove pid none asignment when respawn to fast,0
ops no i have had this in my local tre for ages to cut down on log spam from the broken daemon,0
do we have anything like plugins depending on the corosync nodes if so i shal do this removal via the deprecation,0
this is required in order to execute wsgi py,0
that is just you pasing fo unquoted,0
nit we should kil this bit now,0
il remove this from the review but we do ned to put those in the conf file so it stops being modified god catch and yes i hate that,1
i know that ozie file is unrelated adition but it presents in comand for building ubuntu cloud image,0
oh i totaly mised that this was in a static method of course my bad,0
fyi an hardcoded should be a hardcoded,0
so i may stil be being dumb but let us say you have created a project with a parent id you then cal update project to update the description it should be posible that the body is just i e you should only have to include the fields you are updating description my text however with the code as writen that would not work since the code would claim you are changing the parent id if the code however was writen like this if parent id in tenant and tenant get parent id parent id raise exception then such an update would work it would also ensure that if some one tried to explicitly set the parent id to none for a project that already had a parent id e g parent id none then this would fail as required,0
endswith is dangerous you probably want os path basename instead,0
er to clarify with or without this change sl renegotiate in boringsl always failed boringsl canot initiate renego only acept it as a client which means this line is not reachable in boringsl ports so it does not actualy mater that sl set state is strictly speaking a no op in boringsl reaching into the sl and mesing with it is state machine is kind of insane opensl s renego api is terible given that i am not sure what the test is doing when compiled against boringsl since it aparently does not notice but this change should not make things worse,1
curent action nulptr,0
damned removed,1
damnit not just that but in every coment i have made on this review in the last 10 minutes i have writen apis,1
i would have just made this a separate clas for maximal cal site simplicity although it honestly does not bother me to much the way it is because shadowframe is already a mes clas lockcountracker std unique ptr lockcountdata data public void begintracking void endtracking void trackmonitorenter void trackmonitorexit bol checkmonitorsunheldorthrow struct shadowframe lockcountracker lock count tracker,0
thanks for sounding the stupid mistake alarm grin fixed but also suporting lower uper now,0
huh so invalidbdm and cinderconectionfailed are not handled anywhere in here either not something to handle in this change but sems like a separate fix,0
at this point you may have removed this pid from both watched proceses and pending termination proceses but have also failed to send it a signal is it a suces case if the proces is already dead,0
kil this now and actualy that means you can remove the entire src compile,0
n is not valid syntax unles our custom scripts are checking for that but i do not think they are but aparently it is doing enough to block mathias stop loking closely at code that is how you find bugs dear me i have forgoten my maners i think i have lost my ruber stamp somewhere,0
this function s naming is ugly pls se pep8 on function names i would rather use lambda anyway,1
useles i think,0

it makes more sense to use trans rather than blocktrans,0
since this is going to consume these std strings they probably should not be const,0
e debian frontend noninteractive should not be executed for fedora,0
i wil remove it but it was definitely to fix a nil pointer resolve to find these i have ben thinking we could take a long working api file and have a test inject random crap and random locations and se if it stil parses without crashing,1
this subshel is not corect but could you write this simpler as d proc pid,0
do not ned to lok for a breakpoint if m nul we canot have set breakpoint in this case,0
use gradlegrovyfile getnamedargumentvalues,0
yeah it is ilegal to cal the child boundsinscren method here or asume members of axchildren are axplatformnodecocoa i think my sugestion did not change any logic if the members are al axplatformnodecocoa but it wil corectly handle members of axchildren that are not,0
the purpose of debounce is not to wakeup chipset task when interupt is not valid since chipset task produces mesages power state s0ix 0x1d and this mesage prevents idles task from entering heavy slep ned at least 1 min quiet no uart activity power handle state is caled only when chipset tast wakes up to move s0 interupt and it is defered cal to skylake c power update signal should be not static inside comon c and defined in header file do you think if this change is ok to move s0 interupt to skyale,0
np i wil 2 as son as you fix the problem with py26 tests ps i know we should not be serious and inded i 1 the patch stil consider that several users wil tel you an utility is rubish if the default options do not satisfy their neds,1
this also sems useles,0
use some les sily variable name that is longer than 1 character and that matches some naming conventions abitmap for example,0

use mphonebase setsystemproperty instead do not import systemproperties,0
ad a before the comand to show it is run in a shel,0
here we have one problem if you want to use utils print list you ned to have some object with some fields because these fields wil be used to eject a data from the object here we have only the list of strings so this a litle hack because if you have a formater the data wil be ejected by the diferent way,0
new tab is activated by default and you do not ned it to be active in this case regardles,0
is not there a way to do this in python this wil not work on windows maybe just cal adb devices anyway and include the actual failure in the exception you throw andrewhsieh s scripts were always a pain in the as guesing what they thought went wrong and not even providing the evidence they would used to make that gues,1
it is true i suck,1
totaly agre with it being sily to force host agregates being created where it makes no sense to do that,1
what is the curent behaviour you mean it requires you to delete al the project underneath it first that would suck a bit if i had 10 projects one level down,1
you have already included these keylayouts in the device git,0
nit consider using blockquotes for notes blah blah blah more blah,0
should this and other elements use getwalpaperdarkencolor instead of black,0

aw crap yeah that is bad did you find a concrete example where we are trying to read into an unaligned spi bufer,1
i se sugest revising the coment to reportbadmesage wil kil the renderer proces but mojo complains if the calback is not run just run it with nonsense arguments,0
ah god point maybe we should kil the renderer here we could probably do it with content bad mesage receivedbadmesage since we have the render proces id i am ok to land this as is because i think it is safer to merge though kiling the renderer in a folow up might be a god idea,0
does not openstack po po on using multiple positional substitutions i personaly find that rule completely sily but i got caled on it previously,0
i anoyingly spent a bunch of time figuring out why my api tests were not working at first and it turned out to be mising hyphens in a tenant id so i put this here it makes sense though that a tenant id might not be a uid so i can remove this,0
turns out that this does not actualy work unles you put it before the unconditional line damn you kconfig maybe this was the reason this patch did not work for you furquan,1

it is an unfortunate side efect of the module member of modulenv being const i think that member is worth const ing to comunicate clearly that consumers of modulenvs that the wasmodule is not mutable by them,0
exposing impl clas names in this code is realy bad practice the network object should contain al the data the vif drivers ned if the bridge interface data is wrong we should corect it at the place where it is populated not ignore it in the vif driver,0
nit may be cal it service unavailable it is verbose makes it clear that the service is unavailable not necesarily the preview it is also consistent with the names above where htp sufix response code is loged as sufix,0
realy that is sily i se double quotes used in hacking but it is not caled out as a requirement it is just used that way in the example,1
i have taken a stab at populating config sign types in chromeos config py,0
are we mising a step should not scripts botstrap aio sh be run first,0
i would prefer to inherit this clas and create one more clas clas fakeclientstestcase clientestcase self use fake clients true so we wil not make nasty typos,1
this f should be removed,0
i am not sure i understand can we realy asume that it is type 1 if just the server is runing,0
maybe we should do something to make this backwards compatible instead i use run tests sh so it does not directly afect me,0
i am going to politely disagre these are not diferent scenarios of the same test it is an entirely diferent test case requiring diferent asertions and diferent setup the code loks similar because of al the damn mocking required due to the lack of a keystone test double,1
you culd remove the 2nd part of this coment only 1st part is relevant the content does not mater,0
it is kind of ugly to be diging into mutex internals,1
we should return a bolean in this function and propagate the eror into omapscreninit,0
this backslash is unecesary and should be removed,0
we are in blink code here so we should be using what the fuck mutex instead here,0

i propose to change the sentence to if you do not want to instal the metapackage you can run the folowing script to enable remote rot aces,0
i know this is just a re based change for the r14 branch so ignore the folowing coment if you prefer to kep the patch similar to the one we use for the tot i have changed my mind it makes sense to just make this a static const member local to the sanitize function since that is the only place which uses it you could make this static to this file to but given the large number of these constants i prefer that they were defined in the methods which inturn use them,0
yeah sily multi cursor editor,0

why not changing is deadlock implementation inded is deadlock returns false for postgres ha deadlocks,0
it is a pity you could not use embededtestserverule would it be worth creating something like a embededhtpstestserverule,0

since i am a moron sometimes i did not even think about the active node and spare node pol so i created the active node which serves as a god table to hold the loadbalancer to vm maping and a spare node table which of course has no loadbalancer maping,1
should we kil as wel mysqld safe se,0
but you ned a way to indicate whether the data is valid or not and that requires either a returning a bol and pasing in a pointer since pasing a non const reference is against gogle style or returning a copy and pasing in a pointer to a bol something which was explicitly rejected in a much earlier code review i do not honestly know of a third option,0

actualy i think it is useles as far as i remember create wil execute flush for you,0
i think the above two are sily,1
ah i would forgoten about the disabled by file part of the midlware i gues the diference betwen a graceful shutdown and using the midleware is that one is event driven where the other one requires you to pick a long time and asume that after that there are no requests being handled which would work but the code to implement the graceful shutdown could be prety easy potentialy just a few lines of code so might be worth thinking about it is probably just a mater of changing these functions in wsgi py def wait on children self while self runing try pid status os wait if os wifexited status or os wifsignaled status self remove children pid self verify and respawn children pid status except oseror as er if er erno not in erno eintr erno echild raise except keyboardinterupt log info li caught keyboard interupt exiting break except exception sighupinterupt self reload continue eventlet grenio shutdown safe self sock self sock close log debug exited def run child self def child hup args shuts down child proceses existing requests are handled signal signal signal sighup signal sig ign eventlet wsgi is acepting false self sock close pid os fork if pid 0 signal signal signal sighup child hup signal signal signal sigterm signal sig dfl to lok like this def wait on children self while self runing try pid status os wait if os wifexited status or os wifsignaled status self remove children pid self verify and respawn children pid status except oseror as er if er erno not in erno eintr erno echild raise except keyboardinterupt log info li caught keyboard interupt exiting break except exception sighupinterupt self reload continue except exception sigstopinterupt self graceful shutdown continue eventlet grenio shutdown safe self sock self sock close log debug exited def run child self def child hup args shuts down child proceses existing requests are handled signal signal signal sighup signal sig ign eventlet wsgi is acepting false self sock close def child stop args shuts down child proceses existing requests are handled signal signal signal sigstop signal sig ign eventlet wsgi is acepting false self sock close pid os fork if pid 0 signal signal signal sighup child hup signal signal signal sigstop child stop signal signal signal sigterm signal sig dfl and ad this one line function def graceful shutdown self send signal to child proceses to handle curent requests then exit os kilpg self pgid signal sigstop i have not tested the above i think it might be suficient because the existing code wil do the acounting of the number of children and exit when self children hits zero but it would ned testing you would do kil s stop glance parent proces pid,0

macros are evil period solution works except that you used the wrong naming convention method names ned to be camelcased except for acesors,1
hard coding board names is a bad idea and from what i know discourage by the infra team se the below from asign stable images py n b hardcoded board names are evil this blacklist uses hardcoded names because it is meant to define a list of legacies that wil shrivel and die over time do not ad to this list if there is a new use case that requires extending the blacklist concept you should find a maintainable solution that deletes this code,0
you have imported randint so no ned for random randint,0

because it is more complicated to manage that in this is slow path code it was a map then i went with the lighter weight vector admitedly naming suck i wil make it lockcountdata,1
these regexes are ridiculous if we realy have to use them vs just using a url parser can we extract them as a variable and put some coments giving some examples of what is aceptable please,1
the model and view binder for this mvc component are very smal maybe mvc is overkil for this and al of this can be combined into one clas,0

if you are trying to set this to false and you suced at changing the seting but not at kiling the daemon should you fail the update engine wil not share new files nor try to consume them but the daemon wil stil be runing until next rebot,0

this should be aces ip v4,0
please kil that leftover line,0
the modal id is the same for manageqospecasociationview we should change it to something else,0
i think we can kil this using jsonpath rw ext,0
same as before we should probably remove user names and such from these files,0
this should be self host and self port,0
i think this should be a clas property eg clas basehostmanager host manager hostmanager property def host state cls self host node kwargs factory function property to create a new hoststate may be overiden in subclases to extend functionality return nodestate host node kwargs,0
s defect it is a feature just a crapy one,1
i think we should not blindly asume it x86 atleast we should grep for xeon,0
it sems stupid but this for exception safe programing in theory the asignment to sdl string could fail with an exception and the sid would never be fred of course we do not typicaly have exceptions enabled but stil probably should try and be safe,0
nit wtf is not necesary dito for the rest of the patch,0
does it make sense to cal this test pig job executions,0
why are you mocking this i think you should be mocking the instance update method or even just the save on the instance object maybe you are stil pasing a sqlalchemy model to those methods when you should now be pasing a novaobject and mocking that save,0
god question i think you could check the uma data for net quicsesion conectionclose numopenstreams timedout which logs the number of open streams when a conection times out that should be a god reference point 10 might be a god uper bound,0
remove the backslash,0
monir nits i wonder whether we can fake the tenant id such as a specificaly for internal nsxv mgmt since i also want to create one internal network for trunk use i think it would be beter if we use same fake tenant id,0
nit false frame navigated,0
i think you lost the whole of the original comit mesage here,0
the extension is loaded with a monkey patch of neutron s data structure as done for gbp for instance as i understand we could get rid of this ugly monkey patch with the patch 20207,1
this should go into init objects on the clas like that are going to get misused,0
could you make this an enum something like enum clas parseurloriginrestrictions knorestrictions 0 ksameoriginonly,0
this variable is useles you can directly return ec suces below,0
kial after a lot of investigation we found the beter way to ad tracing to al rpc services without this dirty hack we can just ad metaclas to base manager clas which i am going to do now,0
that is realy sily coding,0
i hate these exceptions py files do not do that declare the exception where they make sense,1
i think the superclas delete method should do this for you,0
can you please ad docimpact,0
you could just inline this in the caling function no bol ret false if checkifrebotisneded proxy ret ret g main lop run lop ret true,0
afaics this is 5b7c91b78b1ce63e0f1f037f6cb4d7c9537d4,0
you ned a colon and a space after your closing paren,0
i do not se a significance to these and i agre with salvatore in that they should be removed,0
trace event1 is a scoped event that used to capture code execution time you probably want a trace event instant1 here,0
nit can fit within 10 line limit run presubmit sh to catch this,0
you can probably write src unpack default unpack sourcecode starcupsdrv src pv tar gz mv x y die,0
do you ned a self skip space here or is any space already skiped,0
sily editorial nit can we put ebos after excelent but obscure operating system or just capitalize that phrase tok me longer than i care to admit to realize you were shortening that phrase,0
agh stupid gerit interface i though that the smal text box for editing the comit mesage online was to split the line automagicaly just like this one,1
use case logd runing as a service logd reinit is entered on the comand line it is only purpose in life is to send a kil sighup to the one runing as a service i could circumvent popen ing out to pidof for the hard coded system bin logd proces if i implemented a private copy in logd or by making a comand cal to dev socket logd control to tel it to reread beter i may just do that instead i always viewed popen as a security hole,0
ugly tab,1
ops wil kil that,0
this is screwed up stupid clang format,1
remove i18n,0
somehow you lost your register opt group here register opt group cfg conf queuing group queuingroup,0
your controler is skiny and clear,0
the lop was this ugly already before so not your fault but while we are rewriting this piece of code can we please make it les k r c style and more c 1 it is 2016 after al not 195,1
does this ned try except logic to guard against the situation encountered in bug 131534 certainly sems like we canot use this implementation in user py due to that problem which sems a shame,0
damn them thanks alex i wil change it in the next round,1
this function is useles,0
this coment neds to be deleted aparently yuan forgot to kil it in change i17f049ea3ef62723efae8086ec427f6e151cd9c i noticed that this patch does changes to the moved code so it is apropriate i think,0
25 26 32 rows should be removed it has no sense beter in another patchset,0
because suported instances is a string in the db and jsonutils dumps turns the json into a string,0
you are right it is useles now i would remove it,0
this script wil be executed on dut with bin sh dash so i think you wil want to use instead of bash,0

the existence of the live migration flag parameter is one of the stupider decisions in nova s past because it asumes al migrations want to use the same set of flags which is wrong we already se example of the wrongnes by the ned to ad a separate block migration flag parameter as such we should not encourage further use of we should have a dedicated live migration compresion on of parameter if we want admins to request compresion,0
instal package o deps,0
useles bind,0
this is actualy unecesary false 0 it was zaloc ed that way,0
please remove the trailing space,0
use local whole static libraries liblz4 so we do not have to build it twice,0
aparently aws asumes that a header value like xf was encoded with iso 859 1 latin 1 and re encodes it in utf 8 in this case becoming xc3 xbf before signing storing so as stupid as it sems we want something like env key header env key decode latin1 utf 8 encode maybe i wil do that as a folow up patch though and fix up request canonical string at the same time,0
actualy the behaviour of the exception aded in this should be the same as what this method does but that sems wrong take a lok at securitygroupbase create security group rule in nova network security group base we should not propagate this crap so we should ad a diferent exception as it inded sems to be and also fix security groups api probably,1
you are right dolph it supose to be a serialized json blob,0
wow stupid obvious mistake from my side sory for this,0

ackyou l also be kiling blink mojom pagevisibilitystate to,0
andrea corected me ignore my stupidity,0
this wil be fine from a functional standpoint we have to rewrite al the config external sh scripts anyway they are inconsistent and unmanageable and ugly,1
the curent extension framework also does not alow nested resources which suck,1
crap you are completely right sory about that,1
dsrs are prety useles with the vanila default policy json but whatever,0
remove al this and just use device information statics below,0
ah ok i wil remove them,0
is it posible to remove these whitespaces in red,0
else is redundant personal style nit i hate having more control flow than necesary,0
what is a dumb key alocator in your understanding there is a fixed key key manager that is used by cinder volume encryption is that anything like what you have in mind lack of a key manager capable of providing unique keys was exactly the reason the patch was blocked in icehouse so i do not know how much a dumb key alocator would asuage those reviewers joe gordon wrote the blueprint states this feature makes it harder for an atacker to read vm disks since it encrypts each one with a unique key that is not stored localy i do not se any in trunk key manager that suports this,0
before caling charfmt getitemset you ned to check if it is one of the 3 suported res txtatr because the darn thing just casts it to swfmtcharfmt which is undefined behavior,1
litle confused why you are using unflushed batch count it loks like you are loking if we either hit 20 batches or have tried to flush 5 times why those two numbers and is that to short of time,0
this is wrong as the code is not run from gnochi but from ceilometer you should ceilometer s prepare service,0
i would sugest changing pkil g service pid to kil service pid because instant kiling of parent and child proceses with sigterm when a parent is suposed to stop children itself does not sem a god thing to do and leads to failures in grenade se 53 54,0

you can mock imagecache in the setup and have mock get cached image self vmops imagecache get cached image mock get cached image return value mock sentinel cached iso path,0
discard data but stil update checksum this is weird we are reusing res not as a result but merely as a dumy value,0
it sems like you should stil divide by procesing unit and then subtract tag length chunk count below,0
instead of overwriting the value after fetching why not modify this get test firewal policy atrs method to acept another parameter for audited like below def get test firewal policy atrs self name firewal policy1 audited audited,0
you can also do this without mock self verifier save results mock mock that patern is probably more comon in the raly codebase,0
please remove slep here and use wait like you have done below,0
should mock the os open method as wel mock patch os open mock patch object os fdopen m,0
comit mesage body should be wraped at 72 characters rather than 80,0
it is a bit ugly to pas respones responsetext maybe utils getresponsetext should take xhr as argument,1
god point although let us do so in a separate patch my thinking is hung task panic should be disabled at compile time and left to users if they want to enable it at runtime via sysctl wdyt,0
simpler if we could just count them and get rid of number tenants,0
shmanager does not contain implementation of remote execute comands like execute through host in os actions py,0
this is reverse to run the test you ned to set skip software config tests false,0
you probably ned to get rid of this one given that you have removed glib s spawn,0
i think thats causing the failures here should just be cfg,0
ap sync ui state watcher is a std unique ptr is this the the prefered way to reset a unique ptr now,0
you should probably throw a fatal eror if the path contains a double quote something that wil abort the build it should not hapen in normal cases,0
i do not think so i thought parameter types none is used for suck old api like fixedip they do not have restrict validation before i think we just use nul at here loks ok for me,1
this operation can become expensive because the complexity is linear with the size of the resync network ids list doing that at every port event and this is likely going to suck,1
yeah me to it suck but works,1
yuck that is amazingly awful,1
this is garbage from v2 and is not in the v3 spec remove it from the v3 implementation,0
yeah this is what i was woried about insert rant here about the stupidity of using configure instead of sizeof in the first place i usualy hack around this by manualy rewriting them as sizeof long et cetera,1

no the destination register for the select patern in quick can have any narow type object r cond r1 r2 float f cond f1 f2 int i cond 1 1 bol b cond false true,0
rather you should probably extract them from objects into dicts here remove unecesary fields and return the list of them like that since you canot realy delete fields from objects,0

i deleted erors test py because it is prety useles and i did not want to ad another useles test for my new exception al this is covered by other tests for other modules anyway,0
this is a dumb question why do local node options here instead of ading a new line local node options before line 80 they are the same node options right,0
right right i am an idiot,0
this wil not work as i said in every cal of create floating ips cls wil be diferent instance we should make this method static to avoid misleading,0
nit i canot help but think this could be below the two if statements something like this if bot option is none bot option netbot make partitions expected kwargs bot option bot option purely a nit though,0

this line is useles since you are not using tmp2 m it s overwriten at line 651 below,0
not sure how complicated it is to write unit tests with a mocked newblue but beware that over mocking could lead to unmaintainable code so you may sometimes want a fake or stub implementation over mocks,0
you should rather nest the mocks that way with mock patch as a mock patch as b do,0
return bolean but this is obsolete anyway based on my other coment,0
nit personaly i prefer fake than asdf but this is just my preference,0

let us just remove this entire block we do not suport py2 6 any longer,0
kil leading spaces,0
can we remove these hacks and only ad them when we actualy hit them,0
continuing coment from left side l18 implement this in each driver instead,0
i hate mixins there is gota be a cleaner way than force this tie betwen this mixin the and the comon db mixin this might blow up in plugins that implement just this mixin and are purely an l3 service plugin they may not inherit from comondbmixin,1
for lines of code longer than five use code block ini lineos,0

let us use flavors 0 format flavor id,0
i use this dumy okay fake test to test the utils parametrize from test config config decorator to test it in a real environment it is beter to have this fake test in the same folder as other benchmarks for nova etc and also to inherit from the unitest2 testcase clas al nova benchmarks inherit from fuel health test testcase which is also a subclas of unitest2 testcase,0

hm i am somewhat confused now this spec started with constraints in the environment then it turned towards discovery now some kind of capability matching but what does it realy do i se some things that could be done based on this spec like discovery but what is the use cases solved by this spec itself what is the overal flow like template author does x template get stored somewhere somebody writes environment deployer does what e g who would invoke the comand on line 140 or 14 what does the guy do with the result what had thought this could be earlier is template author s write template s and anotate them deployer has template that neds capabilities provided by other templates deployer discovers other templates that have the capability deployer selects provider templates and writes coresponding env file deployed deploys top level template with the env file sory if this is a stupid question maybe i have to step back a bit again,0
bom there is your worm storage policy suport right there had not even thought of that use case,0
useles since metrics come from the colectd decoder and not from a filter,0

this has to be symlinks that script wil change i gurante it and having to run setup board again wil suck we could always use mount binds during enter chrot also although that s nastier also quote paths there wrap the dirname in a same w board rot should never bite us in the as but we use that form to be safe,1
wrap to 72 characters when feasible because git log loks ugly otherwise,1

we never use check dcheck in test code and we prefer expect unles the asert failing makes the rest of the test not make sense e g asert true test thread start in a multi threaded test here the token evaluating to true does not mean it is idiotic to test initialize imo but i do not care strongly in general both should pas so this is a mot point definitely not check though,0
ah i was being stupid and was loking at normal route comand not ip route which has the replace operation that exists even on 12 04,0
that is fugly not your doing but hate the constructs negations,1
to be pedantic i comes after h,0

this is realy ugly if network ref dvs port key portgroup portkey network ref dvs port key,1
yes and no this is not suposed to be a generic sesion constructor it is suposed to be a bridge betwen the old parameters that were given to a client and the new ones that are given to the sesion i was trying to make it realy obvious that this is an internal compatability function and not something people se as a cheap way to construct sesion i gues it does not mater because it is a util anyway it handles being given sesion arguments and it may be used in the transition of other clients,0

have you loked at the rest of the methods in this this is how it is ben done it is just a dumb loging nop driver and storing the parameters pased in as keys and if there are many parameters it stores them al since you canot use a dictionary or object as a key you have to use a primitive type thats al this is doing it is not very complex and not very useful bc it is a loging nop driver,0

worth noting the security model in jenkins is such that it is not realy safe to mix trusted and untrusted slaves and it is also not generaly safe to reuse untrusted slaves as such we kep our trusted reusable slaves bound to a separate jenkins master from our nodepol managed slaves if you have a similar split you can simply avoid runing this for the jenkins masters handling your reusable slaves and only use it for jenkins masters handling your nodepol managed slaves,0

this can also make some other thread spuriously start registering as the main thread it also only fols one check but many other things stil lok like it is the main thread like tls and what the fuck maynotbemainthread so this is a very limited ilusion if it is just for your particular tests maybe your code could provide it is own bypas named ismainthreadortest or something that can be overiden idealy though we would actualy run it of the main thread since if the code cares about threading we should probably test how it deals with threading this also sems like it would give tsan a beter oportunity to detect bugs,0

please get rid of the trailing space,0
this should probably be removed and ensure package from stdlib should be used instead,0
it compiled without the anotation do you want me to ad it just for safety of mind i m prety hapy to have it private because it means you canot use the constructor in a subclas or without reflection hacks i should ad an explicit test though i did not check the libcore tests yet for indirect enforcement while this is exercised in run tests a mis is bad because at the time of throwing this for repeat initialization eror the runtime would abort without it i would think a reflection test would be god enough and that would alow it to stay private,0
i think i actualy should not have removed this because there is now a bunch of crap in my working directory,1

wel the logic of claiming consuming instances is not what caused this bug and it is wel tested what caused it is moving to and from objects in the resource tracker and then droping an important field due to that so in the resource tracker we have pci pol dicts would contain numa node as a key but then we convert them to objects 1 by using pcidevicepol from dict which would drop the field and save it as part of tags upon reading them in on the scheduler side we cal pcidevicepol to dict which of course wil not know about the numa node since it is not on the object for filtering to work numa node neds to match and it is actualy gone so al requests fail the code in 1 merged 2 months after the patch that introduces numa awarenes of pci devices tl dr this got borken by our neverending objects fuckery it was not broken by definition as you sem to imply with your coments here the comit mesage is misleading though so i wil update it now 1,1

yea i agre this kinda stinks since it not consistent,0
fk to portprofile profile id,0
i definitely agre we should not mix the two i think the list syntax makes more sense in this case than it does in capabilities i previously made coments to this end on that spec but they got lost in a previous patchset so i wil review it again son take a simple resource registry resource registry os tripleo blockstorage cinder storage yaml os tripleo compute compute yaml what that is saying is that when a template creates a resource of type blockstorage it should use the cinder storage yaml file taking the example from the capabilities requires deployment pupet resource registry os tripleo controler pupet controler yaml docker controler yaml you as the template reader maintainer not as heat programaticaly reading it are no longer able to se what template wil be used that information has moved to the requires area plus some aditional logic that loks inside the templates themselves now factor in the alternative in this spec for using a parameter driven aproach that is now a third place you ned to lok to understand which template s wil be used to fulfil a given type leaving us with the folowing to understand a set of templates 1 lok in the resource registry to se the maping for a type 2 if the maping is a list lok at the requires and the contents of each template referenced to se which one wil fulfil the requires 3 lok through the top level template itself for any resourcechain resources determine the name of the parameter that is used to convey the list of templates in the chain then resolve what the curent value of that parameter is imo this is a rough experience for the user we have taken the knowledge of how a stack wil be created and spread it over the course of multiple areas and files by comparison my argument is that capabilities are not a black box resolution by heat but rather just metadata the user can ask heat to introspect to determine valid mapings to make in the resource registry chains are comunicated inside of the registry itself that flow leaves the mapings in a single place the resource registry it is simpler both for user comprehension and clients that may be layering on top of the templates,0
can you clean up these there are a few others in gltrace h cp,0
i stil think you ned a coment in the entry that is wrong rather than at the top but hopefuly we can just switch to parsing proc pid exe instead,0

this raw 1 9 is prety ugly and we should probably ad a define in a future cl yes that is my fault,0
please take whichever aproach you like software sync itself already violates this location independent policy because soft sync blindly sends ecrw image to update slot which can be slot a or b if we corupt the active slot al the expectations and image manipulations have to be adjusted acordingly active and update instead of a and b so it may be simpler to fix the sequence bot a corupt a rebot b corupt b please note that fiz would not bot on type c adapter if both a and b are corupted on a bj adapter the dut stil bots just like other boards because software sync can fix one of the slots,0

this gzip cal is problematic because it removes the gz sufix from the image filename therefore when you run stack sh a second time download image wil not detect that the image was already downloaded because it checks for the filename with the gz sufix which was cut of by the gzip cal and download it again then gzip wil try to decompres this new file which causes a conflict with the existing file,0

unfortunately this wil no longer work the only reason the ugly code on the left works is because you are caling delete on multiple rows if you cal delete on an individual object like you are doing here it wil not actualy be purged because delete in the model is overiden to just update deleted 1 you wil have to do this diferently i think the right solution is to remove the unique constraint on name and flavorid in instance types and do checking in the create code to make sure you are not creating a duplicate this would alow deleted instance types to continue to exist this sems preferable as you probably want the old types to continue to exist for calculating usage etc this would alow us to get rid of purge entirely,1

hi kevin i am glad you have brought this up as i wanted your expertise on this i gues i am stil not 10 clear as to when to use one versus the other and would like to get an explanation from you on the subject loking at the code i thought that unles you have slaves to atach to one should always use a slavetemplate a leaner object i thought that one should use a mastertemplate if and only if you ned to atach slavetemplates to please clarify thanks,0
as i understand it jenkins slaves sory anita can comprimise the master sory again so if we have the publishing slave or any other les trusted slave conected to jenkins o o they could comprimise this slave which is meant to be higher security this is the long way of asking do we ned a separate jenkins master for this,0
nit i think yuv is redundant here max width max height should be enough,0
this gives you an ugly clas main a how about a self clas name instead also you are repeating the same code twice just to check if the key exists just catch the keyeror instead,1
should this be a bulet item to,0

can we write this as folowis if new ext net id org ext net id or force update and and orgnexthop the is ugly,1

this is a dumb question but this is only caled from pxedeploy deploy i was wondering why it was put into a method here maybe it wil be used by other stuf later,0

this now hangs playback never starts and the promise is never rejected but the oneror above is hit mounir is this new method exposing a bug or am i doing something dumb,0
nit consider ading fatal eror calback,0
did you already put suite wifi flaky into control files in some other cl,0
i wil leave them here for now we may move them when we polish the ui to beter match the mocks,0
this is a bit ugly but this is what was asked so i aded a nul ptr check for inspector agent let me know what you think,0
get conf file name notify s sh state,0
this loks scary does it actualy ned to be non nul some tests just pas in nulptr,0
sm router id is sm resource id now the db api neds to be updated to be non router specific luckily the schema is prety dumb and you can get away with simply renaming al the functions s router resource,0
let us suround this expresion in parentheses so we can get rid of this backslash,0
ops yes editing screw up,1
damn stupid ide done,1
exit code is ugly here hence the grep i wil ad the failed when,1
ew shame on me it was a bad copy and paste wil fix,1
no that is a corner case that we do not hit and that was excluded before normaly you cal something like t int32 t and kbits 8 16 24 i just thought it is fine to alow kbits 8 sizeof t and trivialy return true as the constexpr is inlined and either branch is dead,0
i canot understand why you ask me to rebase previously you used to ask me to split this patch into 2 separate patches for easier review the curent one is for fixing the az info isue and the second one is for fixing the if not host isue the modification of the guy hans is exactly the same as my second patch which is for fixing only the isue if not host so if i rebase as your wish then your previous sugestion of spliting for easier review wil become sily and bulshit right you are not consistent in making review at al i think that both of my patches should be merged to master branch at first because i have uploaded to gerit before that guy and then that guy wil be requested to rebase this things that is should be the right procedure right,1
pecan abort should be replaced with format eror,0
but my varialbe is in line 1 i think we should use the same place,0
you did not list gzip here you are also duplicating what we have in cros build lib py with comp,0

there is now a coment on the etherpad about whether we should stick with this aproach for versioning wil do this if we stick with that solution,0
al these local aditional dependencies are unecesary,0
eapi 4 and then you do not ned die,0
let us use frozenset for afected node ids,0
yep this is just a pupet resource name and it does not afect anything since we pas actual backend name via name parameter historicaly it is named keystone public i think renaming it is out of scope of this bugfix,0
dev quickstart rst also neds verbose false,0
this formating loks screwed up please fix,1
damn typo,1
these are useles once again you should check that we have output data in bytesio object returned by io bytesio,0
i would nuke this initialization then since you are explicitly seting the terminating entry to be nul,0
nit this function is a litle useles why not just combine it into get auth ref,0
test vol name self volume name,0
fuck we ned somehow to resolve this kind of hacks i think such thing like pasing cluster id to task should be generalized so we do not ned hoks in nailgun afaik we do have a bug i think the priority of it should be raised,1
one isues is that this results in a bunch of 404 logs unecesarily this is not a big deal but what about just testing if the parsed args id is a valid uid in which case we treat it as a uid otherwise we asume it is a name and try to search for it this way there is only one query either way and no uneded log erors,0
use shutil rmtre,0
nit num hosts and num down hosts,0
delete the non 9 ebuild and let the build system create it for you,0
did not fuly folow that statement clarify please that said i would probably name the suck remote ref instead of branch i could se bastardizing this for refs sandbox manipulation downside that requires people to pas refs heads master in which is fine imo,1
as in pidfile i was mimicking probably it is useful for debuging but it is not relevant we do not ned it at this moment,0
typo instnace should be instance,0
owner id is the parent stack id is there user case for filter this,0
first i adopted your sugestion honestly i was hesitating betwen what you sugested and the curent version when i implemented this days ago if proces isvalid it could be a direct child of iter second but has ben kiled resulting from it is parent proces being kiled corect it could have ben if base proces open fails on the other hand if base proces open suceds but finds a proc with a diferent parent due to pid reuse we know that we should ignore this proces however it is child proceses may not be kiled yet so we ned to ad it is pid to the flat map and continue hunting for the descendant proceses ah i se that is a god point but if the pid was reused we do not want to kil the new proc s kids to be totaly paranoid openprocesifchildof would ned to report to calers whether the pid was definitively reused or not i think what you have now is god enough for test code maybe drop a coment explaining the posibilities since it is a bit subtle either version works fine for this specific case as kiling the direct child proces automaticaly kils al the descendant proceses gpu utility etc per my local tests yes chrome puts it is sub procs in a job object so that they al should die with the parent at least i think that is how it works you can probably test this trivialy by kiling a browser proc with plenty of subprocs i think they evaporate straight away,0
this line neds to be removed,0
for me the diference from ise and asertioneror is that ae is an eror that is a severe eror that an aplication has no reason to catch that is a bug in the implementation nothing to do just crash ise is an exception catchable represent a wrong way of using an api that is a bug in the usage can be catchable so here for me it is an asertioneror in adition in jack we do not put mesage to asertioneror unles to as some dynamic data depending we have al the info in the reporting to find the line,1
i would prefer it to be tripleo rather than what you have,0
avoid short names like this you can cal this out register,0
volume type id fake volume type id se line 2092,0
how the crap did this even compile done,1
i would remove this and stick with the notimplementederor above,0
i would love to know where you found this monstrosity sometime,1
i think that is an ugly hack and it also means the table is not properly reusable we are curently not reusing the tables but we might,1
corect me if i am wrong but i think here what you want is if x encryption type in auth fn a elif auth fn b else auth fn c authenticateopenor what about doing authentication methods wpa self authenticatewpa wp2a x wep x auth proces authentication methods get self ap encrypt type self authenticteopen,0
this is going to be painful i think that way to so ugly but done,1
is not there a beter way to do this having to put this code in every method is gros,0
via shifting tmpdir teardown into this critical block we ensure that it actualy runs per the comit mesage and per our general intent of kep the builders hapy instrumentation of crap left behind in tempdir would likely ned to land before this point,1
haha i fel dumb now i forgot about the do above and read it as a standalone while with no body my bad,0
one new many new lines but that is realy pathetic,0
yeah we definitely do not do any of that and especialy not the s m field naming nonsense regular sun style or gogle style are both fine though i just pipe imports through sort 1,0
no reason other than it was like 5 lines les code no ned to unwarp grpc responses b64 decode etc as a dumb proxy cbe is not going away anyways,0
s junk junk or s junk considering that is what junk means or beter yet find a variable name that conveys something about what is being ignored and start it with so pylint is hapy,0
updated api cinder qos spec get to api cinder qos spec get keys,0
i think this might be geting more complex than it neds to be you are only batching the port delete and update events which you have already converted into cheap operations that just mark a network as dirty so my sugestion is to get rid of this queue and get rid of the changes to everything except for the port update and delete then just have the update and delete methods mark the network as dirty and then have this helper reload the dirty networks that wil esentialy achieve the same reduction in reload cals without any queue management logic does that make sense,0
this coment might be not be neded as stil makes no sense here anymore nit 10e 15,0
the names are not mandated plankton and twinkie are not drp but both of them have src and snk pdos so i created a separate vif for src and snk,0
dito in adition recomend pasing in things like router id subnet id etc etc rather than relying on them as globals,0
the enclosing clas is not public these methods do not ned to be public either,0
loks ugly se coment,1
ugly can we find a more general test for example if the last component apears to be a file name has a base ext form if not then that is fine but we have to actively sek and destroy users of the old behavior,1
fatal media transfer protocol manager c 52 check failed bus it sort of suck to have a bunch of ifs just to make the test pas i wil check if we can put in some fake bus and get back to you,1

bw limit rule i think ihar complains about var shadowing that hurts debuging,0
for consistency this should be like ad tuntap self as rot link ad name type dumy,0
that is the wrong daemon the signal goes to powerd from here,0
why doing this ah is it because you want yaml dump to dump a dict instead of defaultdict if so please give a short coment for this,0
how the heck did i mis this,1
destroy is doing this when removing al children se inernode removechildren this line becomes a no op anyway since we removed al children out of the clusterlist,0
it is unecesary to ad this only primitive members ned explicit initialization,0
this is horid xenapi agent rubish afaik this makes the agent update the networking info injected into xenstore which can get picked up by the quark networking stack and ovs rules are updated reset network is often caled after inject network to then reset the networking inside the guest using the agent and the latest network info that has ben injected yes yes it is realy that horid,1

you do not have an alow rule for misc block device should not you have the folowing alow update engine misc block device blk file rw file perms otherwise nobody wil be able to do anything with misc block device,0
i would put this after the exception field so it is close to the handle it manages,0
remove daemon here,0
ah okay new plan ad the folowing to the top of ginport invalidatevents void ginport invalidatevents v8 local v8 context context no ned to invalidate the events if the context itself was already invalidated the apieventhandler wil have already cleaned up the listeners if state kinvalidated return then i think we should not ned any special workarounds either here or in the test s js file mind giving that a try,0
aw crap this should be lnodes self ap sort nodes lnodes so that the large object manifest container listing thingy does not always hit the first container server do you want to fix this in this comit or just remove this line from your dif and i wil submit a patch,1
libqmi qmimsg h,0
yeah god cal it is useles,0
yesh you are definitely right about doing to much work here i go to al this trouble to construct the options and args variables and then i never do a damn thing with them what the fuck was i thinking maybe i moved stuf around and left a vestigial copy of this crap siting here wil fix,1
it doesn t se their fixme coment the test was wrong at least in the sense that our behavior and the ri s behavior was the same and also the obvious behavior charset names and aliases are always checked for validity and always checked by the same rules the ri s documentation agres with this behavior to so i have no idea why they puled this test out of their colective as,1
crap i mised that one in the update i wil have to update again,1
the source is a vmap d bo which is not iomem the tm object is unlikely to have migrated to vram so it wil not be iomem and even if it had tm would migrate it back to system ram,0

can we at least check that a reasonable comand is pased to sh this test does not sem to test anything actualy,0
hm are you sure it is corect to use an std atomic like this,0
fuck,1
close i do not think projectspec is the right place i think keping that dumb parsing based only on the schema is god this is yet another thing that i think would do wel in a project clas i think we have talked before about this a clas that wraps the schema comands so the comands could basicaly do p project p buildimage etc for now i would lean towards geting it in but if we want to start that refactor now we could,0

yeah thanks carlos inded that is a nit fixup incoming,0
yeah but it is also sily there is a file entity over in file go so it sems kind of obvious that virtual entities are suposed to be diferent to file entities the documentation on it is methods explain how it behaves the sentence below says what it is used for and the name virtual captures it is esence corectly,0

wel the chancescheduler is given for electing a random host whatever no i just wonder if it is not opening a can of worms to ad more features to that dumb scheduler at least we should properly docimpact that scheduler stating it is limitations,0
we have to be careful here with tweaking the values for the volume status nova peks into the value directly when determining if it can atach detach a volume this raises another stink i have with how nova does those checks nova should not be loking at the volume status column value from the return of a get volume cal nova should be asking cinder if it can atach cinder should answer the question itself,0
fix coment style here and else where notifies,0
inline the count variable it is useles,1
oh i mised that you were caling getpackage joiner does not ned to operate on strings it wil cal tostring on objects etc but that is not right here so scratch my coment,0

i would like to buy your dictionary with your definition of horibly,1
changing this would break the api we should catch the htpbadrequest in the shel py cal and raise the right exception from there also tbh i do not realy mind the 40 eror to be there this code as much as i hate it is short circuiting a check that should hapen server side to begin with,0
because i am dumb and stupid facepalm,0

you can separate that mocks with coma with mock x mock y as mock spawn,0
if i move the method in this mixin clas then things wil be more ugly because l3 dvrscheduler db py file also has more than one place caling to get subnet ids on router so i fel it is god to have this in one place rather than two,1
i totaly agre with you imho neutronclient is already very diferent from other clients and it is something stupid consistency acros al openstack clients is a big topic and it should be discused and improved as a whole comunity and it is already raised as one of important topics in dev ml discusion even when we have consistency acros openstack clients i believe neutronclient wil be quite diferent from the curent one i am not sure what is the goal of this patch if we ned further discusion over al openstack client i think it is beyond of this patch consistency inside neutornclient i agre i do not have a strong opinion on t f vs t t f f so i am okay to kep t f for consistency i would like to leave the decision to the original author imo we do not ned to rush this for juno release,1
yay we are not that crapy after al,1
chris i am sort of of the mind that having only two tests here to begin with speaks to insuficient coverage of the capability and paints us into a corner with respect to procedure e g what if tempest just flat out had a bug that broke these two tests this is something we should bring up with the comite in the interim i would like to lok and se if there are not other tests that could be aded for the capability but unfortunately they would have to go through the advisory cycle first and wil not realy help for 2015 05 ish i wil also note that there is a potential lophole should we fel the ned to invoke it the bylaw states that vendors may not request flaging al tests for a capability refer to c 3 4 for the actual wording so if for example the foundation through it is interoperability enginer presumably or perhaps folks acting on behalf of the board like say the co chairs of the defcore comite though i wil note one of them has a potential conflict of interest in this particular instance as she is employed by the same vendor were to request it that would not violate the bylaw in the interim you are right we canot acept droping al the tests for a capability at a vendor s request so i am 1 stil i am going to lok into whether there are aditional tests we should be including so that they can start the advisory phase soner rather than later,0

i was suspicious because of the initializer must be a non empty brace enclosed coma separated list of initializers for the members emphasis on non empty but with a smal test program sems to initialize int members to 0 while i se garbage values if i do not perform any initialization so i think this sems to work at least when i build with g does the 0 syntax because problems with some compilers,0

it is should be posible to do it in unit tests we should be able to mock out any part of the architecture eg involved parts are lib archive mocked out as fake lib archive volumearchivelibarchive volumereader mocked out as fakevolumereader however the mocking here could be done beter custom calbacks in volumearchivelibarchive are not tested and they have significant and critical logic they should be tested wel designed tests should be able to test everything imho fake libarchive implementation should invoke the custom calbacks so al functionality of volumearchivelibarchive is tested fakevolumereader would be then non trivial and could return fake data as a result 10 of code in volumearchivelibarchive would be tested wdyt,0
sems od to have the buleted list but then this point separate how about make this another bulet,0

so the idea is that each parameter declared under global parameters would be available via get param right i like this on the one hand because it saves a lot of typing on the other hand it brakes self consistency of the single templates so far they were valid in themselves and could be used standalone with the proposed change get param cals would fail or are you saying in 1 of proposed changes that the parameter definition would stil be there in the nested templates only the property definition in the containing template could be left out another idea what about a get env function that would explicitly get information from the environment just a stupid idea,0
this is highly ofensive to non christians i demand you remove it,0

remove unecesary white space,0
yes i found the isue when the paswd entry was legitimately mising i was surprised to se both arc networkd proceses runing as rot in ps under normal circumstances the entry should not be mising and the risk of something afecting this daemon is low but security critical code often gets atacked in ways that because something that shouldn t fail to fail e g maybe the bad guy canot write arbitrary contents into etc paswd but on a normal linux box he might be able to trick a careles cron job into erasing clobering it is contents through symlink atacks and then subsequent cals to getpwnam fail since chrome os uses dm verity to protect the rotfs contents somebody canot get the os to return arbitrary data when reading a file but maybe they can get the os to return an i o eror if the file data is overwriten with bad content on disk exhaustion atacks can sometimes induce failures that are useful to a hacker e g what if somebody opens up 1023 file descriptors then runs a setuid program that fails to open the 1024th fd and reacts in a careles way linux veterans may remember this design flaw in the original posix capabilities scheme,0

so here is the problem with this even if you use a diferent non db driver for the servicegroups in nova there is stil a service record created in the services table the reason is because of the stupid relationship betwen the services table and the compute nodes table this odity is being adresed with the detach service from compute node blueprint which is almost entirely completed so botom line do not asume that just because the db driver is not configured that the services table wil be empty because it won t,1

it won t git handles that on it is own if someone intentionaly is being an as there are ways to pul it of but i do not care about those cases note also arbitrary striping there wil difer from gerit behaviour the basic theme of patchset2 review thus we canot just do striping as you sugest,1
oh gotcha ok i am ok with the dcheck here then because it realy is guarding against api misuse,0

apologies is this has ben clarified in previous review cycles what would be the rational of this unusual aproach to inheritance is that because you ned to chery pick only specific capabilities of the base clas whereas in al the other case you would be ok with the dynamicaly built base clases,0

probably disabling irq should be done after avp enters lp0 this would avoid races if there are any,0

i know the code above suck and is wrong but move this to src configureidealy this would not even exist as it would be in the configure script,1
you ned the colon reps 1,0
i meant the interface here no i meant a list of dictionary representations of the steps this is much more flexible than directly caling the methods in the agent driver s case it is proxying the info to the agent and runing the steps on the agent blah i gues i did not lok hard enough at base py i wrongly asumed al the interfaces shared a comon base clas i meant this method and execute clean step would be on the interfaces not the driver,0
do we ned to kil this thread with join on stop or is it not neded because it is a daemon,0

this is the ugliest extension ever made the author of this extension should be hanged over a pol ful of hungry crocodiles obviously i am it is original author ading more stuf to this extension wil only make the code even more unmainteinable personaly i think external gateway info is one of those atributes which should be promoted to sub resource this wil simplify authz policy management and most importantly the user workflow we ned to find a way where the main resource and the sub resource can be created updated returned in the same api request however if necesary the user should be able to operate directly on the subresource this is probably something that canot be adresed for this release cycle so if there is any urgency around this blueprint we might proced this way and then rework it in kilo however if this patch does not make juno i would sugest reworking the external gateway info atribute and yes we should wory also about backward compatibility,1
it should be db api autonested transaction,0

dumb question return eror here or not curently not sems to me this is okay because the only place that cares at al is the replicatehandof and that one should continue to work as long as the number of insyncs returned is zero which it is here just wondering if this was considered maybe no ned to log here if returning an eror,0

i think you are corect we do not aces the iomus lock protected domain iomus list in the irq that could probably be a mutex instead and therefore only do the irqsave dance on the hw lock can you do that in another patch after this one,0
i think that hiding stuf with cs is an uglier hack if we want to reuse them with a diferent title we have to inherit from them anyways if you do not like that hack then use a diferent template for this table inherit from the original datatable template but modify the caption block,1
so why is not a keyeror raised when unit tests run on this i se that in test hypervapi setup snapshot mocks most of this is mocked out but the debug cal should stil be hit and fail right,0

dear duncan thomas this is not a version comparision here rather a referential comparision only so doing string comparision wil not be a problem actualy version comparision is done earlier and here we are just comparing whether it is none or else 3 2 let me explain actual htps header version comparision is done at we pas string 3 2 to diferentiate the function cal is for microversion if req api version request matches 3 2 none self volume api check volume filters filters 3 2 else self volume api check volume filters filters then here we compare this argument part 3 2 as string comparision here to check if this cal neds to be executed as per microversion or normal hope i could explain,0
like i said on the previous patch i would rather be conservative in cases where there is no prof that this bothers a real user i d bet that not 1 of the users have opened the defaults tab in the run configurations and goten confused about al these setings and cursed at gogle for complicating things real complexities are elsewhere and i would rather focus on them,0

we should probably ad an fk constraint here,0
you are overwriting original filters it makes isequal below useles use depcloning or flags to detect diferences when overwriting values,0
why do not you use self create router name here with that you do not ned the adcleanup anylonger,0
this explains part of the size t int change but i think we might stil want to stick with size t for the driver side for clarity i hate signed int being used to represent the length of something,0
yeah it is like this code has entered a squishing competition sucky if you ask me but agre with the line removal here and below it is consistent with the rest of the code and that maters more than anything else when coding at chrome team scale,1

this should be for obj content in matching ds objects,0
sily nit might be beter to cal it something more like format lun id since it is not doing like validation or anything,0
yeah we should make this beter more clear in os brick since it is prety flaky otherwise i e as the caler i have to know about the specific internal implementation of os brick for the type of driver i am using which suck,1

in the interest of ful disclosure it was pointed out to me by one of my standards comite coleagues that this is not guaranted to be the same type as int32 t even if both exist they are required to have the same size in that case since this would be stupid would result in at worst a compiled eror and we control the implementation i do not think it maters,1

no point in one yet we can ad one to the patch that seals it al but this one is a drop in the bucket,0
i think you mean tox e genconfig,0
this logic should be moved to setup to be executed just once,0

sh t i do not know how that hapened thank you for catching it,1
god point but can an admin set it sily one size fits al schemas,0
i think you are just complicating the code by having this flag here if you let head run past crosing bufer size and do the mod operation when you use it to dereference a member then you can just compare head crosings bufer size instead of having the double logic you have now the only time you have to do the mod operation then is when you store a value al other uses of head are comparisons nit i am also a suck for max crosings namings instead since it is a litle shorter and it clarifies if size is in bytes or entries,1
damn that is a realy smal key you can probably get it smaler if u do list map ord h digest 0 1 btw haha,1
instead of makeany you can simply use the any ctor template which fels like it loks les clumsy makeany is only realy useful if you ned to explicitly give it is template argument se e02a29c0a73e4c2a98ed9c7c290928314b307d improve documentation,0

this coment threw me because i did not understand that the via part was saying that there was an intermediate data structure i would instead say something like maping of directories globs in the directory owners,0
should this take an expect body key arg defaulted to false so we can do al our checking in one place it should remove the ned for some of the eror handling in basedecryptercontext get unwraped key i think to the point that it would make sense to let calers just cal self crypto unwrap key themselves,0
overide we tend to have it on the same line like this objects tostring you are confusing sun s fairly useles one with our fairly awesome one lok at the imports we were here first,0
why you are defining this as a tuple,0

please remove redundant white spaces,0
length 2 and double elements kind is guaranted to be a fixedoublearay hence this cast should just either be unchecked or crash,0
i strongly think that sending complete instancelist objects for every host periodicaly even if it is a longer period than 60 seconds is a code smel if the regular updates work wel this should never be neded if sending such a huge amount of information regularly is neded then the whole update proces suck and should be fixed alexis i prefer the ful instancelist for a host that is not in sync but i was anticipating that some might stil se that as to heavyweight and wanted to provide that option we had not discused this aspect of the spec at either the midcycle or the last gant meting,1
then let us fix nailgun agent i realy don like to se that data asumptions so dep in the code bolean update by agent must die or used at least somewhere realy near the htp handler not so dep in the code,0

you should be using mock patch in the apropriate place instead of manualy patching the library,0
ugh that is an awful interface i gues we could stil make it work with the comon code but we would have to design a new spiflashctrlrops interface to shimy in betwen there that would handle whole comand response operations wel i gues we can also take this code as is i just hope we are wil not have 5 diferent tcpc drivers with al their own spi flash implementations in a few years,1

this wil break if i authenticate by user id or if i rescope a token not sure this code should care about that scenario though,0
let us remove my sily note it is now loged in gerit for the future,0
back in the real world it is the maximum value in a size t you d check it is nul so you know the implementation did not fuck up overflow and return you some smal alocation,1

and this line should now be removed,0
shoting ourselves in the fot is also an alternative,0
this wil potentialy interleave output which suck perhaps atachoutputforloging should have a form that takes a bytes bufer,1
the blank line here is ugly imnsho,1
another shameful nit ad a note or todo to this coment,1
this sems short my pigeon powered mesage queue takes 30 minutes to respond to things and the failure rate do not ask about that magic numbers suck ha p 1 to ading a todo,1
to be fair force volume detach sounds esentialy the same as force delete of an instance the only diference with normal delete is the state checking so if we are ok with forced instance delete why is forced volume detach so terible knowing it is a last resort and yes the recovery rolback cleanup of failed atach detach operations should be fixed as bug fixes for example in the case of a network outage or something which should not hapen but shit hapens and things get out of whack i realy only se 1 force detach api 2 periodic cleanup task or 3 manual intervention in the database from the operator which kind of suck,1
wrap in so that this string gets translated,0

some aspects wil change e g the fk i think it is ok to list here,0
yes we should remove the foreach cal,0
sems that you do not ned self clinet sesion and self node mocks in this test case,0
could mention here that usual alows are alow deprecated alow experimental alow unknown just a smal sugestion,0
remove user id none since that is the default,0
i think the adb bug is fixed now did you try the old adb shel rm instead of adb shel sh c,0
hm that suck are there any long term plans for handling that because this makes me wonder now of dberor is going to be truly enough i gues if we have any places that are explicitly checking for operationaleror we would have to know about this or if places should be checking for operationaleror but only check for dberor maybe we ned a note here or something about why this is neded,1

god that you are computing the count on demand and not storing it someplace that get get out of whack,0
same let us kil them in consequent patch,0
ah so here we never update the port so we must check if the mac adres is ok after this change we always overwrite the mac adres and update it to a value that does work so it is actualy realy dumb what works today if you hapen to pas in a port with a matching mac adres it wil work and we make sure when we create ports we do not use the mac the user pased in in al other cases we sem to just give up if the hypervisor has some mac adreses,0
this clas has no point at al and is wrong i already wrote something about it but if it is just going to be about loading the driver just kil it and write a function get cordinator backend member id kwargs that does what init curently does the rest is just useles and inheriting from cordinationdriver if you are not a driver is wrong,0
why a new function se below,0
i was actualy meaning file there and being stupid the trace is what i want anyway the trace wil now get loged and pas the same short eror mesage up to the caler so i think this does the right thing now,0
the junk,1
we are exec ing out to iptables basicaly so no ned to pas extra garbage to it,0
this canbe deduped,0
yes that is ugly wil change it,1
so here comes the stupid part of go keys make string 0 len datacenters for id range datacenters keys apend keys id sort strings keys for id range keys datacenter datacenters id and this is not generaly extractable into a reusable function because go has not generics otherwise the order is not deterministic and tests expectations wil not always match,0
cleaner return as son as know you have to return action flow tuples self action flow tuples if not action flow tuples return self action flow tuples,0

let me know your thoughts on the most recent patchset it should remove the disconect we curently have betwen the pd task selecting it is own c values and the charge manager selecting them,0
sory i am a dumb robot i do not read what i am writing p you are completly read the curent code is overkil asertin makes more sense it is more readable etc and the previous line already checks the size of the dictionary fixed in my new patchset,0
i think it would be best if we reduce this set down to a single openstack service from git and a single pypi package we do not ned to build an entire repo,0
do we ned to code around this can we just kil the networkinterfacefactory and generate it like the rest atach interfaces to driver could then use interface loaders network,0
damit god cal,1
sure i could be more vague but whats the advantage of hiding the eror from a developer if it is permisions denied it would give him an extra gogle fuck nuget,0
oh crap sory,1
this empty line should be eliminated,0
nit remove useles statement,0
remove extra fields from here i think only network driver is required here,0
nit if you are udelay ing here you should probably be udelay ing below as wel,0
this one s weird because there is also string valueof,0
domain id should not be here only properties in the type should be here,0
ah so you are saying that when we droped the fks the fields stayed as indexes wow if that is the case perhaps it would be a god idea for the todo coment to state this and that these are indexes that ned to be removed rather than formal constraints,0
it would be nicer to use size t old fingerprint end old sdp strspn r n but it sems that what the fuck string does not have a strspn equivalent this wil work,1

why was tunel update mising earlier,0
seriously i hate bananas they are gros,1
also do the equivalent check on e g path with dots,0
i think you can simplify by defining safedelete that acepts f args and kwargs and cals it while catching notfound then in create resource you cal self adcleanup self safedelete data id and in create bandwidth limit rule you cal it with the aditional policy id the advantage is that you do not have to define the wraper in line 23 the disadvantage is that any new create method wil have to know to use self adcleanup with self safedelete and that it wil not be automatic like you did here with overiding adcleanup i am not in love with the idea of overiding adcleanup and i think that any new create method people wil just copy paste something else in this file anyway so overal i like my sugestion beter,0
i have always liked conf files that say crap like update here who reads those readme s,1
i would prefer to se this in a define but not a clean spot to put one plat pm h is the easiest spot as that is where the existing pm check code is but including that here is ugly maybe put this in include linux pm h and include that sems a bit hacky either way although once we get a generic non arm mechanism for pm check it wil get cleaned up,1
this use of span tags bugs the crap out of me but it is consistent with the surounding code so i wil not let it be a blocker,1
this is likely ok since the bad admin role check is no diferent than other priv cals,0

this explict cal to rotwrap apears unique in the code base i am not sure which is right but things like cinder brick initiator linuxfc py do it diferently so i am querying it here,0
this hardcoded pasword loks ugly,1
hm this kinda suck the only reason you would want to go back and lok at a deleted stack is that you might e g want to lok at the events on the resources like to find out when they were created and deleted although arguably we already trample al over that on updates and this is just making the delete consistent i am not sure what conceptualy the right thing to do here is,1
i think alex did some special formating when creating the header with this icon to get it to show up corectly i might ned to do some reformating of this icon to get this to show up corectly in this case presumably get it to 60x60 otherwise it apears kinda ugly wil se what i can do,0
i wish this was amphora expiry age but that is just me being pedantic,0
changed to note that we kil instead yes this is ipc fuzer the garbage generating as i have used ipcdump from the bug,0

complicated why not wait here like discused and fork slep kil 9 just before,0
nice catch here should be removed,0
the joinedload is explained in the linked changeid was discused back in v 10 12 or thereabouts i se that in fact that has ben reverted now about the locking availability ranges are also changed during ip alocation not only create and here i am kind of torn i realy like the elegance of your imediate deletion we have long ago established we do not care about old pols we are not loking for conflicts etc so just deleting them makes sense but i stil fel we can try our best to prevent ip alocation from an availability pol which we are curently updating that involves the lock complete with joinedload hack you are right that i do not use that info i can just use noload to include the lock without loading the ranges like pol qry context sesion query models v2 ipalocationpol options orm noload available ranges with lockmode update anyway you are the third person advocating for nolock so i wil take the hint i wil simplify it for next v let us se what others think,0

this previously used a testnavigationobserver but this no longer works for the filesystem url folowing mustafa s r54850 because a top level filesystem url navigation wil be blocked on the renderer side i wanted to kep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem urls so i tried to use waitforloadstop which just exits imediately if a navigation has not started yet however with blob urls that stil did not work because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side so the executescript that sets location above returns before we have received the beginavigation from the renderer hence this ugly extra dumy executescript without it we performed the checks below to early and when getextcontent below did a roundtrip to the renderer we actualy received the beginavigation and created a speculative rfh which caused getrenderframehostsforextension to fail alternatively i could wait for filesystem urls to fail with a console eror similar to what mustafa did on line 18 does the console eror aproach work for both blob and filesystem urls if so it might be beter to stick with one semi awkward technique for this file than have diferent ones in diferent tests otherwise this sems ok given the explanatory coment no unfortunately blobs do not output the console eror given that i wil stick with this aproach separately in light of mustafa s change once we are certain that it sticks we might want to kil the renderer if it actualy sends us a beginavigation with a top level filesystem url to handle the compromised renderer case and ad a separate test for that yes it would be a god thing to ad to the cancomiturl checks which i am curently working on in,0

why are these subclases like this why not pul them out,0
cthread,0
you have to ad here big note that describes what the fuck this part of code makes here,1

export libvirt vol pol tripleo,0
you canot use math max this values just curious,0
because it suck actualy keystone suck this context provides a way to use non default service types and we should check that such types exists method clients services does not return unknown services,1
list of what public key ids list of strings i realy think this atribute should be removed in favor of just including a link to the child colection instead,0
new unit tests should use mock instead of mox the above mock ified would lok like this def test list instance ids empty self driver libvirt driver libvirtdriver fake fakevirtapi true with mock patch object driver get num instances return value 0 as mocked self asertequal driver list instance ids,0
it can be ignored although the consequences of that config protect wise may bite us in the as to say the least,1
so you are loking past the last endpoint to lay down the spec config this is super ugly,1
dude self stub out,0
i wil remove docimpact in the comit mesage,0
it wil list a litle bit more then a previous comand because arp pings wil included to they are realy short time so there is high risk that they wil not exist when we wil try to kil them as long as we do not check proces existance before kiling anyway it loks god to me just be aware of that,0

it is leftover junk there is generic spi driver infrastructure in corebot used on x86 platforms that i had originaly tried to use however it does not sem flexible enough for the arm socs with several spi buses and lots of configurability,0
your fake client here neds to have a fake client container,0
instances instance nova is mocked at 759 and it wil be mocked again by the stack context decorator which wil then because problem canot mock a mockanything that is the reason it neds to unsetstubs at the end i wil avoid mocking instances instance nova in the next patch to remove the ugly self m unsetstubs thank you for pointing it out again,1
ok mised the while lop at the end of the work function kinda ugly but functional,0
also major pain in the as the sqlalchemy base clas that we are using for these models has a reserved metadata atribute i think it is used for table metadata this is probably why we use metadetails i do not think i am geting around that one would require changes in sqlalchemy,1
might be a stupid question what does pul request mean it sems diferent from usual rpc methods is it a part of rpc calback mechanism i am a bit out of date in the area of rpc calback any pointer would be apreciated for my understanding,0
i do not think check update parameters should return anything especialy not a tuple with 4 items just grab them from the body again,0
kmaxvalue botom right,0
awkward sentence ditch idealy with at the most should probably be with at most,1
why include your whole path here if i wanted to use audit json why do i ned to have a users praneshp code entropy why is it neded to specify an absolute path just specify it releative to the program aka audit audit json or something like that if u want others to use this code then ned to get away from having things that reference your special home directories and such nobody wants to have that in config files,0
nit nulptr stream overide params,0
i am stupid and wil forget to update year,0
wonder if it should be gateway fixed ps 0 ip adres,0
do you want to abort when these invariants are violated for user based tols i usualy prefer a warning unles the eror is fatal but it might be beter to make this fatal so we can catch any erors handling one of these sections,0
aparently because i am a moron nice catch done,1
yay expected failures are for the weak,0
as ugly as it is i think the openstack guidelines say to use one import per line do not they,1
is not the note obsolete i se list qos policies and note say it is not,0
here the same alias sems useles and i dislike it,0
why did you remove instance id seting to context,0
i think the chalenge is that if the asert fails for whatever reason the person debuging wil have to got to the source code to understand what failed i like your doc strings and would like to se something like that in the asertion method something like asertrue int self delta get self ping timeout msg it tok delta to have conectivity after live migrate expected timeout was timeout format delta self delta get timeout self ping timeout the goal here would be to make any failures clear to end users of the test,0
i probably do not ned to do this so i wil check it might have ben left over from this one white lie makes a shit ton of stupid tests work because of dumb asumptions,1

please name ambiguous return values to make the function signature clearer vid pid string er eror,0
given that using memory cache here wil have performance and reliability concerns i think a beter option would be keping a cache of al scripts taged as ads in a separate cache and lok that up here,0
this one sems prety useles as wel,1
this init is useles,0
this is neded for erorlevel thingies below as far as i understod if statements are parsed as a single line in one go by default without delayed expansion interpreter substitutes variable values right away so if erorlevel was 0 before if it is also 0 inside if regardles of any cals there i spend 3h trying to figure out this shit it is highly confusing using erorlevel tels the interpreter not to expand anything until the statement is realy executed,1
maybe die early if 3,0

why not time time self sesion start self sesion timeout,0
rot helper utils get rot helper,0
i would put these inside is service enabled octavia,0
wel that suck that is also going to break any other usage of thread pol executors since the upstream python one also does this,1
sory for my ignorance but why would not std forward calbackargs work here you probably can also use result emplace here and do not invoke the constructor explicitly,0
ok i am fine with the simpler solution here for now i gues hopefuly it wil not be here for to long in the end darn renames,1
please use a mock object with a spec set,0
this may be a dumb question but should not this be metadata key self metadata key value self metadata value,0
okay tok another pas at this and made the entirety of the promise tracking significantly simpler previous code was copied from webvr 1 path which i did when i was young and stupid a whole 1 5 years ago,0

setdaemon true is for that purpose for daemon thread parent thread can die without waiting for it to finish,0

oh right with mock if you do not set an atribute or a spec it wil create a random mock atribute value for you so this would be not none and we can fal into a trap damn you mock and python 2 6,1
i have no idea what this function does but i am prety sure we do not ned it the corebot i2c model requires only very dumb read chip adres data length and write chip adres data length implementations at the driver level other things such as writing the register adres are handled in higher layers,0
remove these from the library interface and al your mincrypt sha h problems are gone,0
this negative logic is going to be tricky as we ad states think about eror vs failed i think as we ad values this wil fail can we select al the in progres states instead in fact i think we realy only want to expose the live migrate ones to start with maybe just lok for things in the status of runing or do we want to include queued migrating and pre migrating and maybe post migrating is that enough,0
lint is ok with this why did it choke on im inlinemethod opcode flags data in the original cl then saying that the after is unecesary,0

stupid question wil this data stream always always match the data writen on line 157 and on or is it posible that we wil in a later version change the data we write read and then this can go crazy if that is a posibility i would recomend making the first field you write out an integer curently 1 to state that this is serialization format 1 in the read code read the int back and make sure it is 1 if it is not do not atempt to read the object stream since it is writen by a later tol,0
right i talked to anusha ramineni in the coments already and am going to remove that bit from the spec,0
please remove these extra white spaces,0

you can drop these die,0
you do not ned to modify fake py you can simply pas a methods parameter to create one server to fake any method of a server object and i think this comand should be os server ad floating ip in doc source comands rst you can se ad remove ad some object to a container object the comand is built in the order of container ad object container object the positional arguments apear in the same order here server is the container and floating ip is the object i think i have done this in so maybe we do not ned this patch,0

floating ip router id nul is redundant,0
sory it sems i put my coment in the wrong place if a user explicitly choses to download into then we are not here to prevent stupidity so i am not to concerned about the seting of output dir the real isue i was trying to adres in my coment is related to out no prefix if i have an object path like container object path opt swift there is no warning or path checking to stop me seting out no prefix to container object path and trying to write files out into opt i think there is a god case for striping leading s from the path after line 106 before we deal with out directory that should give users the flexibility they ned whilst removing a potential source of erors what do you think,0

actualy it would be stupid easy to screw this up set base image file to a precise image of some sort without changing anything else and bam this is broken again for no obvious reason plus as far as i can tel we have never used dib release for this sort of version check anywhere else so it is repurposing a variable that curently just specifies which version of an image to download yet another problem with our abuse of env vars for configuration,1

my fault instead of sid jump to specific page use nslotid then the build eror on macos wil go away,0
i think this is to broad e g if you fat finger any of the code in that block you l be scratching your head think we should limit the exceptions we catch here and include the exception mesage in what we raise,0

remove it btw do you use pycharm,0
this is a dependency we should get rid of as son as posible i know it is just because you ported the tests as is but ad it to the cleanup list,0
is this required,0
get rid of this enum it is useles and unclear it neds to match the length in the aray below,0

please line wrap this to 80 chars,0
yeah this realy should not be an incomplete dict here anyway just doing this would be much beter instance objects instance note that the existing code uses a string id for the instance which is not valid and name is not actualy a mutable property which it should not mater for this to just remove it from the list of properties you set on the instance,0
nit s nonesence nonsense,1

one diference betwen you and chrome is that they build with the ndk and you build with the platform so to you there is one bionic and it is already the latest they might want to include android api level h if bionic and then they can say things like if i am jelybean i have function f or whatever now we have inherited the ndk we plan to make a lot of this crap go away via static linking but that is a way in the future yet,1

remove the white space,0

using data 0 was my first idea but we would either ned to drop const from the parameter list and dirty the interface as eliot comented or use a const cast which is prety ugly besides we probably should not be making raw changes to a std string in the first place a std vector char could have worked beter here or wraping the strdup with std unique ptr but hopefuly we wil get rid of this copying once and for al with,1

you should do this after waiting for the proces to exit as it may stil be writing to the log at this point i do not think you ned s fatal on l74 since it is already the last thing in a defered function in your test function i e the test is done at this point so i would just do this defer func cr close ctx if er wpr kil er nil s eror wpr wait ignore eror since we kiled the proces if er wprgzipedlog close er nil s eror,0

you used plain type again here fwiw above you fixed one by not having a local variable and the other by renaming the local variable either works but it is a tiny bit nicer to be consistent,0
tmp dir should be empty at this point i think beter raise exception from here if something wrong,0
since this is purely a data holder why not make it a struct get rid of al the inline geter seters and aces data members directly this is ok for dumb clases and makes for les code and complexity,0
this wont work the is redirecting stdout to a file caled i have confirmed this in the ci tarbal created yum log has data what i do not understand is why find does not complain about not being terminated by a holy crap i se now bash is weird echo hi tmp data ya cat tmp data,1

could we just use a string here instead of std vector uint8 t it may be more convenient for our users it kind of suck that perf does not give us the buildid at map time the problem is that the dso on disk could change and get remap d that wil break it since the key is the pathname,1
it is a pep8 eror should be removed,0

chated ofline with norvez ahasani it loks like required use dlc suits fine to the purpose fail to build however we move the required use dlc to test dlc ebuild and dumy dlc ebuild to avoid polute this global ebuild,0
not realy 1 we removed that project 2 that project does not have that bug upstream some android idiot introduced that bug localy the right fix is to just remove that project again,1
my bad this should be empty func,0
why did you remove the parameters and go to a generic kwargs that loses the self documenting property,0
alphabeting sorting crap to make sure our test output is deterministic,1
this is a qualcom driver puled in with comit a78d93e2a just a couple of days ago are you sure we want it disabled here,0
whatever s easiest for you is ok with me another cl would be easier for reviewing i supose but if you would rather throw it in here or create the clas now and make another cl later to convert other existing code i am fine with that as wel,0
you are adict to this construction though it is not a must here i would say it makes reading harder,0
the umpire structure is based on twisted and we probably want to use twisted primitives such as deferlater instead of threading timer,0
this is redudant this should be removed or the one in conductors yml should be removed,0
have to think about this do we have any builds that do not al envsetup sh i wil ask brian,0
is this tobefixed coment obsolete the bug referenced is closed,0

you can use dw op implicit value instead of a ful dwarf expresion,1
ra32 suspend should be rw19 for consistency with ra64 suspend,0
this should be procesutils execute in fact please submit this fix as a separate review,0
are we ok with raising an exception here we did not before would not a safer fix isuing a delete on first being not none having said that we should just isue a delete like 1 because it makes no sense to select and delete it is racy and we want to kil the race entirely,0
ad here indented to match the second try except else self fail expected an exception to be raised,0
so sily inded,1
unmanage is implemented for al drivers in base clas as empty one i just remove data was was stored for share that anyway wil be unregistered so i remove garbage here,0
you could actualy remove l31 and l312 and it would work just fine,0
betwen no code is executed betwen tests there is nothing betwen tests a black void just me being pedantic,0
ah why am i so stupid thank you again,0
please remove a white space,0
ignorant copy paste from atrace not sure why they did it,1
this logic manipulate json data as a string it is realy a bad idea json is a string representation of a structured data so we should manipulate the data first and then dump it as json this means params request post copy cleanup params return json dumps params if post data is nested you ned to use copy depcopy,0
damn thanks for cathing this eror from my part oslo neds to be updated so this patch is useful actualy,1
maybe a stupid question where is this variable defined,0
please remove whitespaces,0
do not like the length depth this if clause is expanding to but that is just being nitpicky anal probably is a sign we should ad nonzero to validationpol but that is separate,1
this realy suck as a thing to ned to do it rather breaks the independance of os brick and nova because anytime os brick wants to run a diferent comand we ned to change nova we realy ned a way in compute filters to say include os brick filters,1
i disagre the main problem here is that i am caling do node clean instead of do next clean step in continue node clean do node clean should be a one time shot per delete like tear down,0
i se what you want to do butfor image2 it sems unecesary to reserve the space right after image2 and create oat map pointing there if image2oat wil be at the specified adres maybe if oat begin is non nul could we avoid reserving the space after the image also it sems that image2 s oat map and oat file do not actualy point to the same location would it be posible to make them actualy point to the same location is it posible to violate oat begin oat size oat end with the curent interface maybe we could get rid of oat end in favor of oat size,0
it does not make sense to have these typedescriptor init impl n typedescriptioncount controled sometimes by osl debug level 0 and sometimes by defined dbg util,0
are useles,0
actualy this change is related to this patch ading plan uid in the model makes the folowing statements useles pl uid plan uri split 1 download the plan and insert it into our db pl objects registry plan get by uid none pl uid js data plan id pl id this is why i changed it here,0
this is prety painful a the por developer neds to cros ref betwen two docs to acomplish a simple cidb change and that other doc is a bit long and rambling b it would be nice if we would automate the schema dump maybe the dump can be created as a side efect of a test,1
s imporant important my iner gramar nazi also wants it is it s,1
would be beter to get rid of this and other white spaces below,0
i think lxml is a third party library,0
s5m pmic would help,0
if you respin then please blow away the last empty line,0
if vnic type portbindings vnic direct physical,0
oh yes you eliminated the ar image bufer members however magic window projection matrix stil exists since projection matrix is part of frame data so can we just use that and remove magic window projection matrix,0
use wget then it is significantly les retard ed then curl in my experience,1
the diference is whether you want to go ahead and apend the new fragment if the original file itself is not valid xml or just abort it sems like if that hapens you have other problems and ading some new junk to the end of the file is not going to help i do not have a strong opinion about this though so i am hapy to change it if you think the other behavior is beter,0
this is a bugy line you are registered things with the sed but we ned an end to end test here so you should not do this they were registered with the undercloud by undercloud sh,0
thank you i hate locals,1
rules for init go in init teyou do not ned the domain trans for dhcp,0
only the h for the c should be here the rest should be below and sorted,0
this init is redundant,0
this is kind of ugly uint32 t u32 and int mixed in the same structure,1
so we canot treat as a dict to evaluate if a key is in the dict,0
this sems useles i think you can do something like return iter set itertols chain,0
rpc api version should be bumped to 1 26,0
string returned to user must be translatable wrap it in,0
no ned to hide it similarly to the ha network that has no tenant id which is also visible to the admin no way to protect the system from stupid users,1
lol i am clearly an idiot,0
rather than hardcode json use json dumps a dict,0
for optional arguments retries gsutil opts etc pas by name not positionaly positionaly basicaly makes your life suck if you have to refactor the api say remove a keyword or ad a new one etc note that rule is basicaly true 98 of the time the exception is for methods like get which is def get self key default none in that case since the api is never going to expand change etc positionaly pasing default is fine for gsupload that does not aply note this comentary isue aplies for al other usages of gsupload this is the one i noticed have not checked the others for the same isue,1
this is where i think we should have subclased hostinfo to be numahostinfo or something and pas that into the conection here stabing our data into it like below is les than desirable i think,0
similar here just use oatfilestatus knedsrelocation,0
bdms bdms,0
imo should be console info wtypes text wtypes text,0
i am sure i am mising something why not os storage url os auth token or are you deliberately avoiding them being sucked in from env next time swift is run,1
hm since we have separate proceses one per listener we canot asume that we can only monitor the amphora at this level my asumption is restarting the haproxy proces would be handled by the agent and would hapen before the agent reports a listener isue to the health manager i am asuming that if the agent reports to the controler that the listener is failed it has exhausted the recovery options it has available and it neds the controler to fail over the listener,0
yeah just like the one here below sory i am dumb,0
nit ad a newline before getnameofwraperclas same for mnativesbuilder below,0
yes of course do not know how i managed to screw that one up cl coming up,1
to run stand alone ned to mock utils hash path sufix and use fake rings,0
the should be removed,0
of course sory i am such a dunce today,0
probably a stupid question but should we be using github for the repository or should we be using git openstack org maybe this is a beter question for sean,0
kil the n while you are here,0
use neutron segment types and cluster net providers from consts py,0
i gues this block should be removed,0
i believe should should be false since you do not care about descendents of this uri,0
auto s and gr are not used they should be removed,0
why do not you hok batery soc change and chipset shutdown hok second lasts forever,0
this guy here he has an rabitmq com email adres says you have to set them i also tested without these parameters set and it does not work corectly,0
very crufty the libchrome vs libase question is an excelent one and we should realy come up with an actual plan on that front but libutils is definitely something we would like to kil,0
darn this was in the chesecake spec but you are right it is not there i do think these should be separate steps so yes we should have this as a work item,1
i think you can garbage colect this coment,0
this import should be removed,0
yeah i has a dumb i somehow thought that this object was returned from the agregate lokup and was being updated,0
aded const inlining the constant makes formating ugly,1
now we have ugly ifs above concats this should be solved in diferent way,1
dmitry but locking used only in case of cfg nul and now we are not caling wl update wiphybands in this case,0
brace indentation is screwed up here,1
should be project id project id,0
this is ugly ihmo you can generate the state transition,1
redundant init remove,0
obviously a typo it should be comand instead of a dot e g ps ewlo pid lwp com cmd,0
use a dash as a bulet instead of o,0
exceptions by utils execute should be handled,0
it is hok witch cals if node not found it specified with conf node not found hok value simple hok loks like it is driver managed with via stevedore drivermanager,0
beter way would be make the mocks as setup and make these return values as self members,0
same here it should be a datetime datetime object,0
do not ned to regenerate file contexts or run checkfc above you can just use private fc instead,0
i should 1 this for such an awful speling mistake,1
u o pipefail,0
delete this block catch the condition at the botom of the function,0

nit this should go in the anonymous namespace at the top of the file,0
please move these out so we are not hiding their return code i gues this fols bashate s local fo blah checking,0
nit to be destroyed,0
i think it is beter to clear the whole bitmap at the end of the gc since that wil madvise dirty pages in the bitmap,0
this should be moved to line 212 no ned to asign it here as the exception may be thrown below,0
dumb question and probably not directly related to this level of the implementation so what if the sid has a coma in it is this the hex version of the sid same for the udn below i just wonder whether you may end up signing what you think you are meant to be signing,0
nit should probably use american speling color here same below,0
combine the notfoundexception and emptyresponsexception except notfoundexception emptyresponsexception do not ned crumbs self crumb false,0
ptypedescr is unconditionaly dereferenced further down so this code aparently requires ptypedescr to be non nul as a postcondition of the typelib danger get cal so this should be an asert rather than a sal warn if,0
then you can kil that guy,1
string must be translatable,0
i know this is legal but it is prety ugly just do this uri swift v1 container 12345,1
trust id trust id,0
put this in backticks keystoneauth1,0
stupid me,0
the white spaces wil be removed in the next patch set,0
beware that upstream in chrome they re starting to frown on these single count histograms,0

only the rot disk is wipe by wipe disk metadata,0
i do not se this in the screnshot but in the ux mocks in our email thread it loks like your designer is using chips where they should be using butons for your teamfod that is probably fine but i sugest moving this to a buton before public experimentation same for below,0
do not you want preservewhitespace false here true is for when you insert your own indentation whitespace nodes into the dom which i do not se with false xmlutils toxml wil do some basic formating for you,0
maybe i am an idiot but in this comand you become the stack user and in the next you are rot sems to be a disconect here why are you switching to the stack user if the next thing you do is as rot or is stack rot,0
gah i must have rebased this patch stupidly at one point wil fix,0
why delete hosts here and in the main sync thread get rid of this,0
baselayout is eapi 0 and there is nothing here i se that neds it either,0
how is this handled does it mean efectively no limit i think the comand line requires a value for the limit which is actualy kind of dumb since it does not work wel,0
why not uint32 t why decltype if so the memcpy s below should realy be simple asignments,0
then 2 zeros wil be apended sory i must be dumb,0
yes this is rather dumb,0
this is a litle lame returning a string i wil change it to a mock,0
hm right it suck the idea is to evaluate next alarms for and conditional op if previous alarms are unkw but it does not work here if al are unkw to implement such behavior i ned to kep al previous state and set unkw if al are unkw it wil be easier to have expected behavior stop at the first evaluation not matching the first rule,1
please ad arenaunorderedset to arena containers h and use it to reimplement this clas or get rid of this clas completely kil can be a static function in globalvaluenumberer,0
do we kep this and are there any more pupet files we want to reference,0
ad register a new datastore,0
you could try state sending cmd1 state waiting cmd1 done,0
this actualy loks ugly why not use mock patch like most of our tests do se,1
i do not like overlaying structs but i have refactored this to be les ugly,1
argparse is dirt simple you have already re implemented a bunch of the infrastructure at this point,0
eror nodes nodes to remove,0
execution fail here you wil ned to enclose the string with double quotes also please fix this one as wel your you are,0
minor nit either ad a space or remove one,0
when wil temp file be kiled,0
this is biger than you can fit in a signed 32 bit time t that is what the test was originaly writen for to show that we politely return 1 rather than invoke our right to destroy the planet through undefined behavior,0
nit use std string instead of raw empty strings,0
typo in comit mesage useles useles,0
this wil remove al the whitespaces together with eols and converts output to the very very long line of numbers maybe you forgot some kind of filter like grep or awk,0
asert should be inserted before caled once with,0
apologies if this is another sily observation the pipeline has the proxy loging filter twice what is the reason for that,0
is omnibox output an input section this cs clas sems to be aplying some botom margin at 1 but the name of it sems inacuarate no how about simply changing this to omnibox inputs omnibox outputs margin botom and remove the cs clas 1,0
nit multiline coments fdajfdsakjdfs fdsj fdjdsfk,0
i think it should be removed,0
why not seting the custom policy file via cfg conf policy file then we wil be able to kil that remaining argument for init making api as clean and dumb as posible,0
i wish we could get rid of that automagic thing but i gues we have to live with this forever,0
can we ad a note here of why do we none when not there or ad the note in l47 nit stupid coment i would extract this to a separate function this one is growing to much,0
args cat comand options if you ad this line very litle of the original start sh neds changing,0
this coment should be put in textcontrolelement h,0
the clas does not aply an abc abcmeta metaclas so i think it is useles to use this decorator,0
you can just delete al of these asertresponsestatus cals,0
invalid intendation,0
i had forgoten but that curently fucks up al the indentation,1
remove or update,0

sake of argument if not update repo and copy acl and push acl exit 1 i m being a bastard,1
nit get rid of batery percentage and just return the values directly below,0
i would change it to this al pupet openstack clases and resources should be declared in granular tasks directly not via openstack module,0
nit codegenerator codegen,0
i wil remove the pxelinux condition uploading a patch son,0
you should probably use asertgreater here instead of an asertrue,0
nova can pas this to ironic via the instance info field only as this is a per instance seting and should be removed when the instance is deleted,0

these are dumb parsing routines we do not ned a valid request type to know how to respond to the request as long as we have al the descriptors we ned in other words the request is stil valid even if we do not recognize the request type,1
this is done by adoverflowfromchild because we have aded colapsed borders into visual overflow of table sections and table rows,0
yeah probably my bad i told him to put it on absoluteresource and countableresource i meant to say put it on absoluteresource and reservableresource,0
i do not know actualy acording to git history lecam or drewry are the best ones to ask i would ping one of them,0
i would have just made this a separate clas for maximal cal site simplicity although it honestly does not bother me to much the way it is because shadowframe is already a mes clas lockcountracker std unique ptr lockcountdata data public void begintracking void endtracking void trackmonitorenter void trackmonitorexit bol checkmonitorsunheldorthrow struct shadowframe lockcountracker lock count tracker,1
just a coment no action requested if i was to go crazy which is not in fact in doubt you could also ad empty checking here as wel and you wil find you can kis strip out a few isempty cals that if around getintfield of course not al of them because an empty field is used to report an eror whereas a zero return is not an eror,0
yea but my inclination here would be to not have this define at al if this change proves to be performance neutral or beter acros more than just cafienemark and we can convince ourselves that suspend coverage is complete then i would just do it and remove the existing code if not i would revert this patch conditionaly compiled modes are an invitation for destructive bit rot,0
what about not options comper and options compare options dump,0
i am totaly fine with pushing this toward a real bolean,0
i wanted to destroy the objects in the same order as the original code while loking back at the code i think my first patchset destroy them to early which could introduce other isues so instead in patchset 3 i have used scopedclosureruner to ensure objects are destroyed in reverse order of the declaration and get the same ordering as before your change,0
the isue is with testmanifestversionedsynconepartbranch it stubs out manifest version buildspecsmanager which is responsible for initializing manifest version curent version that means it stays at the object default of none then when the manifestversionedsyncstage getnextmanifest runs it tries to use manifest version curent version which is stil none and we hit this eror here when we try to print out none there s multiple ways to fix this but they al kind of suck the test is trying to exercise just the stage without geting to much into the manifest version internals so i put the str here it s a non isue for forceversion because it is given a real string rather than puling out an uninitialized due to test stubing version of none,1
yikes sily me you are right i mised that change somehow could we update the docstrings of such methods to explain that if a port is more than once in the list that means we expect the event to hapen twice or thre or n times i gues that is the curent behaviour right thanks for the patience rosela,0
i would have guesed that this would show up right next to define config spi flash winbond that s in exynos5 comon h should that define move here or should this define move there,0
ugh i am an idiot this coment makes no sense because i did not se that lines 30 3 were stil part of this function please ignore sory,0
the busy prune id 1 uid does not clear it merely removes one entry if it neds to i figured the 1 is very clearly not a ulong max it is real purpose it to check if it is stil busy after the slep if it is stil busy then we want to tel al the readers to go away we kil them then do yet another run to clear al the entries ulong max if it is not busy then we preserve the readers and let one more run go unhindered the one line coment on line 63 describes what we are doing it is obviously not enough coment,0
if we end up being here we would want to change the value of nework name to conf vmware integration bridge,0
since jsonutils dumps takes care of invalid input it is beter that we construct a raw faulty input here like this req body os update readonly flag readonly true self asertraises webob exc htpbadrequest req get response fakes wsgi ap,0

i think you have moved to using self descriptor cache device type,0
get rid of trailing spaces,0
these are incorect for sklrvp and should probably be removed,0
as is this wil not work these wraper objects are keyed of of their backing view widget window there are stil references to getid using the axauraobjcache in axwindowobjwraper for instance there would be a weird split betwen the axwindowobjwraper using axauraobjcache id s and axviewraper using ids from your unique id counter and they wil not be guaranted to be unique,1

i wil run this by you in case my brain is not working corectly build packages in background is always true right so not builder run config build packages in background is always false so this entire block of code should never run edit so it only runs for afdo builders should it stil not run on most builders,0
it should be a symlink,0
yay death to on these obscurely named suck s another name idea precomitdatause,1

man i suck at abc s lol,1
this sounds as if you were ading a feature inded you are here fixing a very stupid bug it would be beter to use a wording that makes it clear something like fix ganesha config option registry further improvements posible,1
just a stupid question but might not be important now what if user specify p internal bus spi and p ec at the same time,0
sems your editor also changed this so another whitespace nit,0
that wil require handling the mocks in that comon function which wil lok mesy,0
this is a prety stupid mechanism if i ned to change the code anyway there is not much point to have it as a config option they should have just put a weak referenced nop uip log in the code for others to overide but i gues that is outside the scope of this cl,1
yes another story in that case contrack is useful because sg rules are stateful,0

it semed a extra black at the head of the line,0
i wonder how much of the code that is being created to be asyncio compatible is actualy handling this eror since as far as i understand it every usage of yield from neds to be wraped in a cancelederor and the code neds to handle this ocuring 2 though to what eventlet does that is similar being bad since the code it monkey patches has no idea that a exception like cancelederor maybe raised at least code created for asyncio should be somewhat aware that cancelederor s may hapen,0
wow those getslice s are ugly,0
and kil this line,0
about deleting if instance could not be deleted if dns record is not present sems like a bug automated riping is ok avoiding instance we already have discused it so i think doing same with dns on instance fail is although ok mgmt cal sems like optinal ability but not the main purpose,0
you could cal me pain in the neck but there is no from we are not pushing anything from pupet master agent are poling so i think we ned another preposition here,0
this is a more general coment but similar to the cli i wonder if we should preface api names using lb as something like members is a very generic term such name colisions is one place where quantum s aproach of everything is a top level resource kind of suck,1

bol initmbr false this is c code it is beter to use c keyword to indicate a bolean value,0
map reflect type is ok but geting this reflect type out of jobconfig is not ok try it it neds two levels of reflecting indirection to get to the underlying oneof type due to how absolutely retard ed oneofs are in go,0
this comand should be removed,0
are we going to move existing ftrapv users like libpng over to this i suspect an abort wil be a lot les painful to debug that the curent sigils which always end up on cferis desk because of their non obviousnes,0
elf64 adr these are not in the roms it is creating a bufer that spans the size highest adres sen minus lowest adres sen however that logic sems broken and things just hapen to work because location 0 or first loadable segment adres in this path,0
they are screwed i do not think so the original version didn t at least,1
darn i was hoping this would obsolete the regexes completely,1
yeah they are horible but they miror the memset names,1
i would prefer you instantiate the atributeror,0
as in other files consider verifying that there is no trailing garbage,0
wtf with generator as vm at least cal it with vm genereator as vm,1
does brilo suport platform development on windows android doesn t otherwise i am starting to think this is a mistake we are doing comand execution but only in a very limited form we are doing environment variable substitution but badly it fels like the best we can hope for is to achieve parity with the shel but we already have perfectly god shels your example provisioning script loks identical as a shel script except that each line starts with fastbot the to much rom for hacks is probably a god thing soner or later there is going to be some custom bulshit an oem neds you to do and then you either hack that in to fastbot or have a separate shel script you ned to run in adition to fastbot provision this is why android s init is such an awful mes they wanted it to be minimal but bad things hapen when you colide with reality especialy in areas where oems are involved the recovery image links in an arbitrary oem provided so to solve the equivalent problem there yeah the shel s not lovely but the alternatives al tend to be worse i think windows is realy the only strong counter argument and even there that just makes me think python rather than shel although for the level of complexity you are talking about a bat file is probably suficient anyway,1
this as wel probably neds to change i think the idea that peter had using the user name might help with these sily typos,0
if this returns nul because of ome we should be careful to not get another ome causing a recursive throw abort,0

that sounds like it is blocking the user right my concern is it is prety easy for users to type a dumb search e g search for the leter a acidentaly and then be stuck in a frozen browser what do you think,0
that is fine i kinda prefer it as jsonproperty since that is clearer what it is and i doubt the dumps loads time is meaningful but dont care that deply,0
you are not mising anything i was just being stupid sory about that,0
it was suposed to be in human but it is a lame description anyway,1
se it in theaters now devserver 7 kil harder,0
above eror was due to transport url not being obvious that it neded substitution values notifications topics should be notification topics searchlight indexer,0
aded al but the last one i may take a stab at that tomorow,0
i have generalized this to include al context managers as alex prescribed i have also left a general warning not to be an idiot about locking unfortunately it wil not reach it is intended audience,1
you should remove these whitespaces,0
we can start fetching the image data only when webstate is valid but it does not mater if webstate is destroyed after caling this method would you prefer to use if webstate return instead of dcheck to make it safer,0
local path libcbeter with include cal al makefiles under local path cal al makefiles under local path libc,0
if it is performance critical a single vector wil have beter cache locality so may be faster i agre pair syntax is ugly both of these arays are stacks so i would indicate that in the name maybe something like mentrystack and mtypestack,0
this should be a helper function serversbyname d server dutestserver d,0
1 should not this be a certificatexception 2 it is not that you failed to cal it it is that the method itself failed thus i sugest checkservertrusted failed e getcause,0
to my knowledge it does not modify their model it just reads from it to set up the tre view if you ad remove entire modules i think some of their code i did not touch may muck around in ij s representation of module structure sigh i know that suck i wil have to talk with alex to se how we want to synchronize with gradle it used to pick up changes automaticaly but he just modified that to kep it from kicking of import tasks while you are editing the build files by hand,1
dumy,0
remove i think this was unecesary before already kstackalignment is size t,0
get rid of fi elif echo config fi,0
have i mentioned that puting the tenant project in the uri is retard ed sigh,0
p90 s3 is a child of p180 as you can se below,0
perhaps a stupid question but what would the type of that pointer be afaict tasks init is an aray of an unamed structi gues i was also asuming that the compiler would take care of this,0
sems like you do not ned here to inherit from both clases utils requestscenario is a subclas of base scenario anyway,0
this loks like a typo do not you want getproperty htp s same below,0
nit make this an even dumber struct by removing the ctor and changing line 103 so that it zero initializes the instance via availablelanguagealiases available aliases,0
what if we get kil 9 d,0
not if main plugin contrail,0
consider typedef std vector uint8 t bytebufer,0
how about we just retain the socket self socket eventlet listen and then,0
nit may be it is more clear if you strip n at your get value from conf file above instead of doing it at each kil,0
yeah i have tests but they are suposed to go in oslo comon when this gets moved there as wel i was not sure how to go about that i have definitely tested this buger though i am using the test code from this change iteration,0
those two features are not suported by pyrax which uses novaclient i would rather submit a patch to python novaclient than put an ugly hack in the cloud servers resource this work should be done in a separate blueprint,1
crap loks like is backend avail always returns false for sqlite in memory and tests are always skiped we should ad a special check for this case,1
the chatiest uid and the chatiest pid within the system uid of 10,0
loks like you have a bad rebase because live migration copy disk paths only takes a single argument now so we have this in the multinode jobs for live migration testing,0
that is just sily if we realy woried about that we would also include the date and the log tag and the fact that this is of clas eror,0
out chanels,0
jni entrypoints are not used by quick remove them it is also wrong to do this direct trampoline with them as they may throw exceptions,0
this ended up not being used and is a sily shortcut,1
so wil quotas get screwed up if it is an admin user deleting a tenant s instance,1
i do not se where this is used in this cl is it already in use but the import just mising,0

i would extract this marshaling into a util function to avoid repeating it twice but twice we can stil manage,0
we should use oslo log here,0
return value of make chrot should be propagated loks here like you are just ignoring if make chrot fails,0
and this check is useles since you do get start none in the next line,0
pol id sems to be just the string this would be like the folowing import uid join str uid uid4 d 1 c c b 3 9 a f 2 a 0 4 b 4 1 9 b 4 5 0 2 5 3 f 4 6 a 4 f 8 9,0
could you move the mock execute code into setup function for example p mock patch object self driver execute self execute p start self adcleanup p stop self execute asert caled,0
it should though the for each observer macro is dumb and expands to a non const iterator since we only use this internaly in this file i think it is ok to leave this as non const,0
you should sob,0
you should not ned this any more i kiled androidconfig h a while ago,1
how come you do not set closed true always should you also nul out contents,0
should this be beter rounded by kbitsperbitmapword maybe roundup roundup num bits kbitsperbitmapword kbitsperbitmapword sizeof uintptr t kpagesize though it may not mater as kpagesize is a multiple of sizeof uintptr t,0
because these vars are not used i wil remove them,0
why is not this a nearlabel,0
hope i did not violate any policies with my statement to clarify i caled myself dumb here,0
it is not often you put suck s wanted on a spec and one shows up so quickly,1
why do we ned this loks like an ugly hack,1
i do not want to be nerdy but i wil be hapy it this line wil be removed,0
yeah because it confused the hel out of me that i was fixing the wrong copy of the code,1
ok let us discus this on the next cl with the cancel abort then,0
hehe sory this was a brain fag just re visited and saw the cat here,1
crap that coment is in the final tre but not in this change i wil se what i can do,1
i would cal this launchaboutblankinewtabfromchromelaunchnewtab to me caused me to think it was an ntp,0

updated to a single experiment with multiple mutualy exclusive options now,0
shal we just kil this and amend if when this lands,0
mocks 0 se test create post ok,0
can we do this for a single ci job so it does not take up time on al jobs for example we could do this on the nonha jobs by ading a nonha switch to the toci jobtype for lop in toci gate test sh,0
realy for read i would have imagined that you would not become completed until after the stop condition hapened i just figured that maybe write was finishing early if it is aplicable to both cases how about at least combining it was the if test above sems sily to have if a blah else barf if a blech instead of if a blah blech else barf,0
fuck that it wil be used on this wek,1
how about using socket gethostname if we run both the frontend and the dispatcher on the same host wil not this always be localhost,0
i do not think you ne the sql backend bit here the code is in the sql py,0
the only justification i could provide is that we could have aded an asert that the token being removed stil exists to ensure they are not generating storing garbage we never actualy did that so this is fine,0
so why are why not doing the validation on the input waiting for the failure sems sily to me,0
should not we reuse the stuf we have in silent cal there is a logic which updates action logs 0 also i think we can reuse check 1 which we already have by just inheriting new clas checkbeforedeploymentask as checkbeforeprovisioningtask 0 1,0
cur ration is terible name,1
it was disabled first then enabled for testing i wil set it to disabled probably ned a conditional codec checking in the unit tests to,0
keystone admin port,0
simplify this by removing bol uptodate and returning false here,0
damn i am realy bad at this should not hapen,1
special value 0,0
stupid nit aded vs available or acesible from the client perspective maybe,0
honestly this description suck no idea what is done and why and also what was done to test this change imagine a canary build breaks and tre sherifs ned to go through cls quickly trying to pinpoint what cl might be at fault this description does absolutely nothing for them or for the people who might be going through the blame history and trying to figure out why a particular line of code has ben changed,1
urgh anoying how much work is it to test the users how many are there in the first place can you not just inspect them manualy and make the change otherwise i sugest switching to python,1
i think admin only can be removed,0
usualy the polsters in ceilometer interface directly with the python client is that going to be case as wel does ceph has a python client,0
se my coments on patch set 1 regarding making al this logic shorter or perhaps do sosa s sugestion above which eliminated a lot of this,0
i think the lines from here and below is clearer like if mesage lines self mesage mesage lines 0 self extra mesage lines mesage lines 1 else self mesage self extra mesage lines fix whitespace here,0
minor for start end in self netw,0
damn you are right my bad the alias table was even malformed but this was hiden by the ful resource table which masked it completely this is now fixed thanks for spoting this,1
as per eike wants rtl logfile context author kiled without any replacement and yeah that probably makes sense could you adjust,0
line 30 lol yeah let us kil it,0
ops that was stupid,0
this line must be removed you are already doing the destroy in previous line,0
i think it should be melanox s sdn not melanox s nms,0
temporary conversion ctors are unecesary here now so adesc aname argname adesc adescription argdesc,0
hm sems i made a stupid rebase,0
forgive me sometime i am dumb and i love reinventing the whel,0
this sems useles as the above glgeteror has cleared the eror state,0
makes sense but if that is the kind of restriction someone wants to enforce could not they just use the policies seting instead of the roles i do not mean to be a jerk i am just trying to understand what extending the semantics of the roles style property protections gets you that is not already available from the policies style property protections,0
these canot be inline functions because gtest skip depends on being caled in the right function we could wrap it inline bol checkxrequirementshelper const std vector xrtestrequirement requirements vector bol setup skiped bol ret false auto check checkxrequirements requirements vector if check log warning n nskiping test due to reason check n if setup skiped setup skiped ret return ret define xr conditional skip internal requirements vector setup skiped if checkxrequirementshelper requirements vector setup skiped gtest skip this also gets rid of the weird bol dumy,0
i am not sure why would we or we can make it empty in o then remove completely in p,0
do not you ned a ifeq host os linux block so this does not try to build on a mac,0
there is a posibility that the manager would stil be runing we ned to check if any proceses left and kil them,0
no i meant parsing the output file you have a caned perf data and you pretend to run the daemon and then move the caned file into place that sems crazy why is not there an entry point into the encoder you can cal directly,0
meh loks ugly any sugestions,1
that is enough david can you remove your verified 1 please,0
i think we should you know we wil hit it down the line if we don t,0
you ad sanity execution in l 987 so that please run here only smoke suit,0
ugh sory to kep sending you these badly formated cls fixed,0
this should actualy be a fixme to pas it in to right loking it up right after we create it kinda suck,1
numa topology get numa topology,0
ack i am okay with two levels of encapsulation encircledimagesource is potentialy reusable beyond vectors and the anonymous function is just avoiding duplication of the localy relevant ugly details,0
was there a reason for not caling cros build lib die no one catches systemexit sems like you should replace al the other raises with die at the very least sems like you have an extra set of paren here,0
the oslo service api just suck,1
so here you wil reintroduce bug waiting to be fixed here you should probably rebase you work on top of it,0
why do you include this in your driver patch loks like a bad rebase,0
this loks sily i d just kep using n registers code item instead of these,0
grovy is awful so no also this is in builder not gradle so there is no grovy available here,1
i like that beter this whole definition was a bit of a pain in the as,1
your indentation is mesed up again,1
we should remove gradleimport curent build tols version and use this one instead,0
it is son time to find a por soul to update the v8 cheat shet phtps docs gogle com document d 1deaqln4zcvkauzhihoqvf2aovl 7uekvi3oq c,0
output is mildly ugly but it is stupidly useful in comparison,1
darn you caught me actualy there was an od isue as son as i aded a second periodic task this test started failing because dbapi touch conductor was geting caled twice i have not dug into why that is i wil file a bug and note it in the next revision 1253426,1
this madnes would not be neded if subnets were a dict,0

one day we should get rid of these gotos,1
i wonder why these are brought in multiple times admin pasword and admin tenant name and admin user are dupes,0
remove control drive param,0
i think the lt and gt are not neded here and should be removed,0
here to you must replace bin sh by bin bash,0
i think you ned to move them to the makefile presumably bulid core config mk because envsetup sh is not a musthave to do a build for example our buildbots actualy do not run envsetup sh,0
use ostringbufer to construct the string or at least drop the 2 useles intermediate string vars,0
i was going to be a smart as and complain about how i would find rsplit limit 1 more readable only aparently it is maxsplit not limit and it does not let you do that typeror rsplit takes no keyword arguments serves me right for wanting to be a jack as p,1
i gues gogle c naming would be hkdfsha256 not that we are remotely consistent about this personaly i think hkdf and sha256 lok sily but ah wel,0
ah did not realize getwebmediaplayer is a public method that is nasty but helpful in this case done,0
nulable false i think,0
useles,1
ah you have removed a real code here please put it back,0
this coment is useles after v3 dispeared nobody ned to know the history,0
i would prefer not to have the except exception block on this test or any of them if an exception is going to make a test fail just let it go through and fail instead of throwing away the type mesage line number and stack trace basicaly next time i am editing the ring builder and i make a stupid typo and get a nameror i want to se nameror in my test output so i can go fix my mistake,0
port id returned obj floatingip get port id or original obj get port id if port id is none return,0
i think d should be s because obj id is uid,0
in the documentations curent form i do not realy se any real value in this scheduler if it is designed to make scheduling faster but does not work wel with multiple schedulers then what use case is that that being said i do think there is a real case where this is valuable se above coments,0
agre that this line should prabably be removed,0
fixup nulptr,0
remove al exra spaces,0
nit you do not ned to set a return value,0
should be nsx logicalswitch,0
why get rid of this die it sems god,0
why do not you return the entire replication driver data is replication volume ref enough,0
i am dumb and forgot how this works instead of caling onsekframesuces we only execute onvideosekedfortrackchange,0
does it stil make sense to have these env names when they do not exist it is geting sily now making up a name glib env that never existed,0
i know it is kind of stupid but there was a requirement that said that there should not be a period at the end of first line in comit mesages not sure if it is stil true,0
this is useles since you overwrite msg fields at l71,0
i promise not to do anything stupid until i forget this promise,0
you could remove this mock if you cal drv cleanup destroy vifs false in line 13676,0
the param in params is useles in this conditional if you ad the params get param check you might as wel simplify this down to if params get param,0
why is this change neded would it make more sense to have the scriptstate scope in scheduledaction execute localframe because some cal sites cal scheduledaction execute localframe directly,0
nit i think that we can kil everything after the coma now,0
yes we wil use that table directly without modification,0
change to run playboks sh script and on line 16,0
tuple repos 0,0
it is ok we wil remove this script entirely son,0
version prefix self build,0
a litle bit ugly but i do not know how to make it beter any advise,1
die is always valid,0
hah i already vetoed that trybot urls are not readable to the public so it is anoying to put them in our git history for al time the gerit coments are beter,0
the alternative is uglier imo,1
these should be emdashes without a space before and after the entity,0
loks like an ugly hack why,1
probably client should be removed,0
crap thought i fixed that,1
kil to,0
yeah the str cpy family of functions are a disgrace,1
is there any special reason this is a define function and not a normal function i do not think there is any botleneck here,0
yeah i know it is dumb but i think i prefer using child everywhere clas name file name your conf option above is mute child already,0
fake git sha1 here image is a mutant that was not built from any specific point in the tre this wil not be typical once we get to production stable images,0
oh stupid mistake thank you,0
wtf kind of use case is this,1
remove linebreak,0
i aparently have gone through this idea but no base64 encoding is an internal implementation detail of syncprefs which of course makes the local variable above useles removed,0
myisbinary myistrict yeah i know that is not as readable i sometimes skip the is as redundant mybinary mystrict,0
no ned for that basetestcase resets al mocks,0
please next time do not write trivialfix in comit msg this is useles information here should be why this comit neded,0
i want to split ovs core mask and ovs pmd core mask chunks,0
test shel mocks raw request and json request of htpclient because earlier sesionclient was htpclient child test shel tests self client for htpclient and sesionclient so now we ned to mock sesionclient method to,0
self fake subnet loks useles,0
i think you ned to indent the s to make them recognized as bulets,0
key set id and mime type do not apear to be used so i would simply remove them,0
i think you want a here,0
i think it is beter to remove the here,0
use a namedtuple for this so it is easier to tel what these two fields are suposed to be,0
remove initcap on example,0
1 suck i actualy prefer the curent version any input from andreas,1
why not simply self server id self post server,0
crap forgot to ad this when comiting the latest changes,1
this start end pid filename are something that can go one heirarchy up that way you wil not ned to repeat these again and again for each snapshot these are constant for a document,0
kil those sections below if they are not neded,0
how about this one poling interval 2,0
please also remove the nosuchruner clas from exceptions,0
but i would rather we thought about which new languages we ad i do not understand how you decided which ones to ad here so let us just stick with the same set of languages in this change and we can discus increasing the set of languages separately especialy because the cldr data for non mainstream languages is often of very low quality i would rather not include a language at al than include crap data for it,1
that is a typo i do this the whole time stupid bash mesing with my mind fixed,0
nit s there their aw mat you are usualy so hot on comit mesage gramar p,0
although providing a default implementation of compare is les ugly than judging if compare function is nulptr before i prefer to kep separate item arays for display and sort the proces is first sort then display the keys used to sort are not exactly the same as the keys used to display it suck when trying to think how to compare samples by their sample count,1
yuzhu so i tok a lok at where i would think the documentation would be on guarantes lack of guarantes of state after a watcher was signaled with a readable signal and did not find anything that clarified this is there somewhere else i should be loking given that we have some code that apears to asume that a watcher trigering with a readable signal can always be read and some that doesn t it would sem making sure the documentation is clear about what asumptions can be made wiling to give me a pointer to the documentation i should be considering updating,0
thanks dazhao i wil remove al of these blanks,0
mising acesibilitycontroler acesibility controler shel get acesibility controler,0
wel yes typicaly one of the sily mistakes i am burdened with done,0
these fopens should have ben o cloexec to,0
you can initialize them heremockimagemanager mock thumbnail manager nulptr,0
we should validate the id i tag obj max tag length,0
nit uneded initialization,0
wow that is crap,1
ok this relates to the remove items cal in obj py no longer being comented out sysmeta should never be updated on a post of any kind,0
blah does not always work in this case hostname does not work and host expects a host id not a hostname,0
is the pas here useles,0
it realy ought to have a penalty for nested ternaries,0
this block should go after the 25 07 ms entry below,0
we don t ever implement any of these for real 1 2 if you want to axe some more code and i recomend it you can get rid of this line the server routines to nop list one bogus function from util mach child port server c and five bogus functions from util mach notify server c,0
get rid of bits in byte you can do div round up ad out pixelbits 8 instead,0
ops must have kiled that by mistake,0
trailing white spaces should be removed,0
0xf0 is slightly more readable since the constant it is being compared to is the same as the one it is being or d against in the else clause though i am not sure we should bother to let the switch value take a 3 byte form perhaps a stupid example but what if we want an alpha of 0,0
ls l keystone comon sql migrate repo init py rw rw r 1 peryse peryse 0 mar 9 1 1 keystone comon sql migrate repo init py loks empty to me we do not want it deleted we ned the file so this directory is stil a valid python import,0
i think it might be easier to just kil al children something like trap kil exit i think should work fine,0
yeah dumb as bug introduced in final cleanup fixed al outstanding isues in cl 3676,1
probably remove this bit about the working set of tolchain sources and download tolchain sources sh since they are now irelevant,0
can you remove this function i do not like i prefer that your remame the function has action plan finished,0
i wil go ahead and do this reference code suck here,1
if you are kiling the upgrade loks like you have got more code you could scrub,0
you can remove useles extra space in the midle,0
the wording here is awkward how about this the caler is responsiblefor caling mock ofload dir cals if necesary or just omit theasumptions and state merely what is mocked this sets up mocksfor stats reporting based on should suced and then cals ofload dir once,0
hm ugly but done,1
we no longer depend on d2to1 when using pbr this line should be removed,0
it gave up here and mised this trivial rename to your explanation of there being to many files makes sense stupid git although i gues since the package changed it could have ben that to if you do not understand what a package is this file loks like it changed a lot,1
aha stupid me for some reason i thought this is printed for constructor s help and that it describes constructor parameters,0
can we do this in init host instead i hate these conditionals here,1
this method name does not lok sugestive to me what about check user has aces to subtre,0
wtf,1
why do not we use the hole nan the pair type is a litle ugly,1
note the new lp64 check we do not want to fuck 64 bit bit up like 32 bit was fucked,1
agred with paul that we should create a wraper for the kil function to replace al the kil cal in this file probably can do it in a separate cl maybe something like this bol kilproces int pid bol kiled this wil return true if signal is sent or the proces is already kiled false otherwise the caler can use the kiled to check if the proces has already exited,0
you should reuse helper method on botom,0
decorator loks ugly beter use mock patch in code also should ad negative test,1
yeah i fel that if we put the pid into the args we do not ned these extra hops,0
trailing whitespaces here ned to be removed,0
yes though i am not 10 convinced the new version behaves as it should because i have nothing to compare it with it apears to work the same as the docs sugest it should z the timezone or name or abreviation the does lok right from what i can tel stupid character isues aside,1
self provider subnets net comon deletablesubnet client s for s in subnets,0
i am using std function perhaps this include is not neded for it removed,0
provide an overloaded constructor instead nuls are evil,1
this ads a single garbage colection list cleaned up in the finaly clause unfortunately it ads an indent here which makes the dif crapy,1
yes it is probably useles as i got rid of the shared mem acquire for this case in an earlier version and forgot to remove this,0
extra white space should be removed,0
name loks a litle ugly to me i would create someting like clusteratributesplugin and used it yaml has nothing to do with this at al,1
you could probably strip leading but i do not care that much if you don t,0
how the hel does this work also if this does what i think it does you should consider just reworking the methods already there,1
let us return a simple std string here as pointed elsewhere,0
right useles here,0
okay i wil remove the hardcoding internalurl,0
please stop the mocks with a cleanup action,0
imo this loks a litle ugly state states eror is the way nicer,1
we should remove post deployment end here,0
not forever the comand wil be kiled athtps chromium review goglesource com c chromiumos platform tast tests 15730 1 src chromiumos tast local bundles cros video encode acel video go 30,0
i want to ensure that none of the fields get droped for e g if resource state got droped acidentaly in the code there should be a failure,0
sory i did not make myself clear i think you are ading qualifiers to make the conflicting symbols weak in cr50 corect can you alternatively tel the linker to hide al cr50 symbols and only expose explicitly whitelisted ones i e the fuzer entry points that the fuzer neds to cal,0
the thought was that a negative pid would always be invalid and it is unfortunately an implementation detail made it so kil 2 would broadcast a signal to pgrp 12345 instead of pid 12345 every once in a while but rarely there could inded be a valid proces with that pgrp,0
this is a hideous way of dealing with polymorphism,0
hum ugly tabs,1

it wil be run undef haproxy,0
ya i do not like being a scheduler lol imho this sort of goes back to michaels blogs post question about why did not they just make this yield from a coment or why did not python just adopt and embrace grenlet s and say have a interpreter option that would use grenthreads vs real threads transparently since in the worst case u are placing yield from on every line of code especialy in i o heavy aplications and at that point it makes u wonder what the heck is going on with python as a language,0

this is suposed to be a thre state flag i use it for both detecting if we can stop checking for the host to schedule to and for storing default results i stop checking in two cases first when a wrong id is suplied or the host is found we can safely asume that there wil not be any other hosts asosiated with specified volume if there are such hosts sth is probably very wrong and my smal optimization wil not do any more harm we set it to false and return it on the other hand a user may forget to suply or decide not to suply volume id and in this case al hosts should pas in this case i set filtering result to true and use it as return value if on the yet another hand it is set to none that means that we have a valid volume id and are in proces of filtering i did it with two variables at first with self kep searching and self default search result but this aproach apeared to be excesively verbose so i desided to use a thre state flag instead,0

hi marios so far this patch is just a test to check whether this can mitigate lock wait timeouts the aim of this patch is to validate the hypothesis regarding these lock wait timeout failures honestly i have never ben a fan of this aproach and i would push for this patch to be merged only if we are unable to do anything beter,0

agred for the logical change but imho we should not document things that are not suported or we should mark it as suck what about puting ignored at the end or maybe just put not implemented as doc like you did for the others even if we do not mark it implemented false in this branch,1

nr and sys are the two comon prefixes for the userspace constants for system cals i forget which is sysv and which is the other one so you ned to grep your linux kernel tre for clone or read man 2 clone or whatever what s hapening here is that other than flags and fn being the wrong way round bionic clone s arguments are the same as the kernel s syscal that is handled in the next block up here we are stashing the two arguments that bionic clone entry wil ned later i d like to reorder to remove the ned for the later block but some retard made this public abi so i wory i would break something i d also like to kil pthread clone and just use this more general form but since we probably have to kep this for abi compatibility anyway it s worth thinking about simplifying al this for the 64 bit architectures though,0

hard coding board names is a bad idea and from what i know discourage by the infra team se the below from asign stable images py n b hardcoded board names are evil this blacklist uses hardcoded names because it is meant to define a list of legacies that wil shrivel and die over time do not ad to this list if there is a new use case that requires extending the blacklist concept you should find a maintainable solution that deletes this code i am not sure if this necesarily aplies to the tests as wel debayan already aded a mesage stating the ned for skiping the test on these boards and we can change that to a todo predicated on the fix for the asociated bug ading dshi for his thoughts on skiping tests for certain boards due to board specific isues here are couple other examples of skiping tests for certain boards builds,0

these are not the same thing afaict this is introducing a second level of aproval for blueprints first you have to get the spec aproved at which point you can start working on it then you have to wait for a runway slot before reviewers are permited to aprove it if two reviewers found time to lok at a proposed patch have 2d it the idea that we should block merge due to not having a runway slot is just stupid,0
sily me thanks abhishek,0
damn i forgot about that i am gona fix and chump,1

i am not quite sure what are you doing here you are ading to sesion object that is already aded and then you are deleting it by the way i wrote a manual about this cases and usage of soft delete model soft delete wil produce n queries for each row and if you use query soft delete it wil produce only 1 query so this solution has terible performance and i think it contains bugs,0
oh i se what you mean yes i think that is corect onchildprocesdied wil eventualy be caled when the other client unbind and i gues we get kiled by the om since cplh keps it bound so when it does a restart it does not reuse it updated the coments,0

ah that is one part of the console protocol that i should have documented beter in case of suces the answer should always be ok r n and nothing more the only exception is for the kil comand which kils the emulator i would prefer if you kep it that way if you ned to send information back dump it with lines ending with r n then dump ok r n,0
yes the problem is realy about the params damn the name how are we viewing it are they parameters to the cluster check operation or they are parameters to the register cluster operation if they are for the cluster check operation we should leave them to that operation to find out the contents inside if they are parameters to the register cluster function we can leave it as params for sure hope you finaly get my point and very sory for blocking this for a long time,1
yeah this wil not work with absolute out dirs abspath v should be used instead,0

next time i would cut this nonsense of avoiding an import,1
damn god idea done,1
personaly i am not crazy about combining the get with the create it is trying to do to much for the dev imo and duplicates what the get and get al methods are suposed to do i would rather the dev try the get se it does not exist then cal create themselves but maybe i am stupid,0
you are not actualy using this ret value here or below you can colapse this into just if pipe,0

if you never care about the binary being in the list you can use f to only output libraries f n f also you could sped this up by executing scanelf on al your files at once but you are probably only copying a handful of elfs at once so it is not that big of a deal,0
nit put this elsewhere in the file like maybe above canswitchime so the switch ime tests are stil next to each other,0
nit kil this coment,0
general robustnes nit bit of style in particular don t asign to the atribute intermediate values you mangle the hel out of boto file throughout the folowing values asign once the value has stabilized the reasons for this style do not strictly aply here but the style should be used regardles since it is god form basicaly if ever dealing w cpy initializers threading etc take your pick having intermediate asignment like this means you have got varying state that can bite you in the as worse if the init method goes and invokes methods to finish initialization if an intermediate value is stashed on the instance the method can use that value w out you geting an atributeror etc thus asign once stable upshot the form i mentioned is safer and it is also marginaly faster the later is true but so smal it is more a joke than a valid reason exempting extreme cases,1
this newline should be removed to comply with hacking rules,0

nit parens are unecesary and ugly but consistent with other methods in this file so no big deal,1
damn you spoted that one fixed,1
this should thrown the webdriverexception with the string like you did in the previous cl,0
the cl does not delete it earlier making it a member means it is deleted at end of urloaderfactoryimpltest scope and it being the first member means it is deleted last by c rules this is usualy the paradigm for testbrowserthreadbundle make it the first member so it outlives everything explicitly managing it via unique ptr here merely resulted in it being destroyed before resourcemesagefilter which tries to post tasks in it is tear down,0
i think it is beter that prety tox sh includes deleting pyc files,0

why do not you want to expect both keyeror and atributeror,0
who deletes this object i think you ned to make renderthreadimpl hold a std unique ptr to the filter,0
if you have image location 1 then you do not ned image location 1 because it wil be included there,0

someday we are going to regret having these hardcoded everywhere not that there is a beter way to do it here,0
this wil be caled for every source frame we might ned to wory about sqrt but i would ned to profile i wil try comparing performance to versions that stub out sqrt it is not much of an isue on my desktop where the total cost to record the 3 latency derived metrics is 3us it is 10us on my pixel 1 though that includes re calculating a sqrt from n frames ago to subtract from the windowedanalyzer s acumulator so there is 6 sqrts total per source frame 3 metrics 2 sqrts al the sqrts curently use double precision but i am prety sure single precision would be god enough in general after geting the basics in place i would like to switch the double precision math over to single precision where we can if we realy ned to we could use a sqrt aproximation as long as the aproximation is monotonic it should be god at tracking relative performance deltas even if the absolute value might be of a bit if we realy realy ned to we could also remove smr rms only neds to cal sqrt on a reporting event much les often and not when a sample is aded,0

why changing the behavior here and below we used to abort with a check if we could not read the vreg and should not we log warning we could not aces this vreg it is useful for debuging at least maybe by changing a kenablex to true to enable it,0

as far as i remember the does not work in python 2 6 is it intended btw why format at al why just not to use six text type getatr db object db id name,0
it might be time to rename this to pid then enter pid is not inconsistent with pids,0
use checkpoint id instead of transaction id,0
oh so dirty hack lol btw this could be done in one line of code deploy id args f func conde co varnames index deploy id but i think that it wil be even cleaner if you just make this kwargs setdefault deploy id default deployment id f args kwargs,0
yes it should be kiled if it is stil around i wil ad this to log mesage,0
is this to fol corebot into thinking that the nor flash controler is on bus 9 maybe we should ad a coment to explain what this is,0
javadoc style for coments outside of methods,0
just checking previously al of this stuf loged at the debug level in the gate right i am concerned that we are going to lose some visibility by doing this with this patch it is imposible for a user to change the loging level for these other modules as there now al hard coded to warn right i totaly understand the motivation for wanting to remove useles loging just wanted to raise this point though before we do this in neutron as wel i gues nova has ben doing it for a while and it has not biten them yet thoughts,0
this is useles check the code below already raise valueror in that case,0
should this be a string some int or uid,0

you could make this final and remove the nul asigment,0
nit actualy a does not work you must specify args also name is run remote tests sh,0
yes that would be an ideal layout we would probably only change the names of the checkout repositories in the manifest i e the git repositories would stil be aosp platform external qemu git and aosp platform external qemu android git in order to kep al git history on the other hand we canot create external android emu yet until we have completed the code and build system refactoring but that is where we should shot at,0

maybe if instead of doing the delete object in the background you could fire a delete container request into grenthread and the explicitly unlock it with an object delete in the test then with that setup if you wanted to get realy fancy you could give the retry lop a mock slep that wants on an event which you uncork after deleting the object,0

posix says unsigned long so we can 1 go with posix and have to ad struct statvfs64 statvfs64 and fstatvfs64 later 2 go straight to 64 bit for statvfs but break expectations about these types in printf format strings say this patch takes option 1 it makes me slightly sad but i figure it is only a smal extra helping of turd on top of the big fat turd we already have,1

since you are using kwargs it would help to know what the posible args are that you suport i have discovered instance id key and value also it apears that either a metadata must be provided or b metadata key and instance id must be provided or c a key and a value must be provided but there is more i am curious why you chose kwargs for these thre while you have named args for metadata and metadata key which are both defaulted to none why not this may be a dumb sugestion so my apologies if it is make the signature just init self context kwargs and glean the rest as you go,0
perhaps should be pid to guarante pid is empty on an eror,0

i understand why you may want to mock objects for rules and policies i do not folow though why you pas those mocks into create policy here since it is only pased thru to registry m that is also mocked i believe you should create a separate mock in the test case to represent a policy object even beter you would instantiate a real object and pas it into driver create policy same for al other tests that cal to self driver directly overal for those self driver tests you do not realy ned to mock out policy and rule object implementations at al you would ned those mocks for tests that target qos plugin py but they should be moved into a separate file anyway so consider avoiding uneded mocks for this and other self driver tests,0

these names are not meaningful they should be caled something like num volumes total size and volume size and there should be an aditional one for num volumes per host,0
more ifdef nonsense se below,1
olga i disagre on this point it is god idea to make names more clear because create queues is somethine wired as wel scenario ouptut is something else and should not be used for such thing,0
you discarded a bunch of field copying here,0
i think there is fundamentaly a race doing this here and i am very skeptical of the necesity to alow this on containers who is put timestamp delete timestamp,0

ah damn god catch you are making me rethink the way we are doing things here esentialy al we realy want to do is make sure that what is in cryptauth matches the curent gcmdeviceinfo now that i think about it more we probably do not ned to store anything in preferences at al i think we could just do the folowing 1 inspect the gcmdeviceinfo and the local device metadata if they contain the same suported features we are done 2 if they do not then force enrolment sync until they contain the same suported features in this scheme we would not ned to wory about the listvalues at al since we would not be storing any values in preferences we could just extract a std vector cryptauth softwarefeature from both the gcmdeviceinfo and local device metadata what do you think about this idea do you se anything that could go wrong here,1
this sems like a crapy way to emulate the platform2 behavior but my shel fu is weak,1

that is the reasoning to enforce this i have aded renderer debug urls to urls that can not be comited by a renderer proces this should result in a renderer proces kil if the renderer tries to do it let me know if you prefer a dcheck,0
thanks for renaming al those it is realy a place to make dumb mistakes,0
you are leaking memory here by creating a new testmesagecenter then not deleting it at the end of your test if you atempted to submit this it would be reverted due to the asan bots please make test mesage center into a std unique ptr,0

this is not clear for me why we put aborted here async true means task wil be aborted even if it is status is init or veryfying so comand wil not wait for status runing this change loks not corect,0
nit stil useles,0
i gues that i use nova and neutron to define the rest of openstack and both use them bare of course i think they are stupid in general since whatever they are doing could be plumbed into log info directly that said we could ping in the oslo chanel tomorow and se if there is a standard,1

horay for kiling layout client after edge never understod that one,0
already here implies that the kil above was not involved in it is death it is posible that the proces exited due to the kil since stoprocesandblock does not know anything about the pid it is kiling i would therefore sugest instead that this mesage be proces pid has exited and that you use slog this 2 or something like that since this could be the normal case are you sure you do not want to return true here,0
it wil be kiled when the scren exits,0
i wil remove them,0

why should this ever be false in this case,0
yes version loks like useles,0
is there any ned to preserve the old code in a coment beter to just delete it,0
yes this is the only caler that we care about there is another caler that dumps debug info on the host but i have deliberately left that as tl because it is more of a dump of what is stored in the actual headers i did not want this fix in the resource table because it does not care about the frameworks in general this clas is suposed to be that glue,0
style these braces are not neded to match surounding style remove them,0
gr i gues the rest of these comit the same ofense but man i hate it,1

gruby should be listed here,0
there is no vm here so vm lastrun should just be var lastrun,0
super is best used for notification init realy is not that form usualy you ned to control the flow some folk argue super should always be used but they are also stupid and wrong my way is the one true right way joke aside it could be super if we wanted but this is not notification thus avoiding it especialy since super basicaly forces you to have the same prototype the whole way down gogle for python super considered harmful ful elaboration of the above is there,0

yes ned to pylint the suck,1
this is kinda dumb and ineficient in some cases we can probably first memcpy the whole data to make it word aligned do the conversion in the lop and then memcpy the result back to data we can also check if begin is word aligned and skip the memcpy when apropriate hdyt,1

dirty busines of mixin s in the context of where this is caled this is going to be the l3 plugin so you do not ned line 324 and you can just do self,0

this in particular sugests that this should not be a bionic test you re alowed to ad your own gtests to cts,0
1 yup agre maybe we can reduce it to 1 hour for the 7 tests 1a 1b 1g etc so we can complete this test in 7 hours god sugestion 2 i se i wil ad more coment on top of it the basic idea is that we should not ping dut to often i think at least 5 mins maybe we can chose 10 mins or 15 mins we wanted to test the capability of dut to maintain an idle conection with ap this involves time synchronization wake up from power saving mode dut should remain the conection during the test this recal me that i should also disable power manager powerd to prevent system entering s3 in wifi firmware it should send out kep alive packets to ap periodicaly for example every 10 seconds to prevent ap drops it,0
this should be colapsed so that the lw is al in the log warning,0
the oficial spec says that multiple values per key should only be alowed if the key also is speced to suport coma separated values in a single key i e if fo x y is a valid header then fo x fo y should be as wel in al other cases suporting multiple header values is not in spec the problem is that it is dumb for al the server implementation code to have to check for whether or not a header value is a list and it is also dumb to make single value headers lists just for the sake of consistency so hapy to change this if you want me to but i do not like the tradeofs it leads to,0
sounds like this should not be a dcheck but should be a reportbadmesage,0
i actualy kind of like option 2 especialy given how few adb creat calers there are but actualy i was just being stupid here i would mised the erno side of this completely and was just thinking about the debug loging,0
these deps are not neded since we already instal them in testenv above,0
so this the should be const charclas pcharclasptr asyslocale getcharclasptr,0
this should be vlan and vxlan trunk suport i wil edit it in the next comit,0
or just use uint64 t flags we wil have moved on to other things before the other 59 flags get used actualy fuck it you can use your last flag as android dlext use flags2 and ad a flags2 field anyway,1
should be enable service h eng h api h api cfn h api cw,0
i am just going to kil waitforservice because it is dumb,1
endif config lid angle tablet mode,0
this should be a uid i think al id s here id volumeid serverid are uids,0
here the fact that we kep trailing empty fields is anoying,0
nit skcolor target color should animate initial color target color,0
how about initialize is loaded to false and here use drop count and below return is loaded,0
use dobin instead do you ned the py prefix there is a pref to not instal like that anywhere newbin util unpack ftb py unpack ftb,0
the engine and conection is managed by get sesion and uses lazy loading it is beter to use them rather than write twice,0
are al of the id s in this file actualy resource ids if so then let us cal them al resource id for clarity,0
given that the old code was wrong there is no config envsetup make let us just kil this it is al clearly dead code git says initial import from cupcake,0
should be fs type sysfs type,0
sily nit per hacking these ned to be double quotes also the sumary goes on the first line check the convention,0
this is kind of sily,1
ned to be inside a begin decls,0
so this wil kil execution entirely is this something we want to do or do we just want to drop the particular result we are loking at,0
maybe a stupid question why are not you not using the decorator instead of the contextmanager given the curent with statement encompases al the method edit doh nevermind just saw god dan s point in ps12,0
use mkdtemp and nestedtempfile,0
should ad die here,0
lp14546 moved to the next mu note should be removed,0
ops changed to set this mock verifier to a signedexchangehandlertest s member field,0
let us eradicate the black magic stdout stder utils execute chrot chrot dpkg query w f package version pkgver list stdout split,0
ncolfield should be size t as wel,0
lack of punctuation here is confusing this upgrade is a dumy since there was a mid air colision moved to 19,0
1 next line wil crash with a unhelpful eror if there is an eror and there is no data,0
ah crap my bad i misread the proto docs,1
useles conditional if you folow my sugestion,0
the old thread would only kil the sync service thread if it failed to write the ermsg what do we realy want,0
should we deprecate and kil neds reload then once tabloader logic is in lifecyclemanager as wel the only client is sesion restore now irc maybe ad a coment with a todo and a bug for this,0
i think a patch is neded for utils drop unique constraint instead of migration patch if migrate engine name mysql get fk from table test fk columns in uc drop fk drop uc create fk,0
forcing shutdown of service service pid service pid,0
hm are you reimplementing a worse i915 gem object get pages,0
just asprintf this or return a std string no sprintf in new code,0
can you please use mock instead of mox if posible,0
sugest just returning the sesion here and create the client instance later tuples are nasty when undocumented i thought this was an eror at first,0
my mistake this neds to be manageable otherwise it wil hit the 20 minute timeout in the set nodes state workflow above,0
can you make the text match a non admin user wil not be able to execute actions,0
i think we can get rid of these they should be unused,0
info normal status mesages showing measurable units of positive work pasing through under normal functioning of the system should not be so verbose as to overwhelm real signal with noise should not be continuous i m alive mesages how can a race be a normal functioning of the system the race should be kiled or the log trace is useles and should only bug the developer to do something about it,0
actualy there is already a comand for taht restore default comand so i gues that is fine but at least ad some coment below to explain the hack because that is realy not obvious and in 1 2 5 years a por dev wil stumble upon this and wonder wtf,0
graph type none and in body if graph type is none graph type default graph type,0
why is this neded we should be using instance objects now so this is ugly,1
fixup is a git comand that gets executed when runing git rebase autosquash it is not meant to be published that way,0
this function is useles and can be removed,0
kil the white space in the coment,0
an activity might have multiple intent filter test the action view for one intent filter not for al intent filter within an activity,0
maybe a dumb questions but this does not lok like a fake but it is in fake py what am i mising,0
sounds god to me let me save one of those thx,0
er i was trying not to touch these but what the heck i renamed other flags to and reflected them in the crev com c 1287016 thanks,0
asertin,0
done that was just for git cl lint complaining about sprintf vs s n printf nothing important,0
one thing that might confuse dumb people like me is that here we are talking about deprecation from a deployer perspective as we wil migrate the same api over to the new repo and it wil be consumed in the same way so perhaps make this dumb prof by stating specificaly what you wil deprecate,0
i did not know you could do this with isinstance wil do,0
why are not you caling sucesful completion or failed completion for this part,0
thanks very helpful we wil use this convention,0
changed resp self sh lsfconsistgrp fc map id kep this function the same,0
i misunderstod what you were asking there are to damn many diferent kinds of macros al with very similar names i thought you were asking about macros like posix advisory info which must always be defined but whose value tels you whether their feature is suported obviously these ones ned to be defined but now i gues you were actualy talking about ones like posix s repl max which should not be defined if you do not have the optional feature it belongs to obviously these ones ned to not be defined as for posix2 fort dev note the if in what posix actualy says if this symbol is defined in unistd h it shal be defined to be 1 0 or 20809l the litle fd next to the name means that this is part of the optional extra fd fortran development we do not have that so we do not ned to have any of the defines and it is probably les confusing to just remove them though as you say in this case at least they let us set it to 1 if glibc does not have a macro that probably means we do not ned to either and also probably means we shouldn t have it i canot think of any part of posix we suport that they don t,1
creating a new fake client splits the actual and expected values acros two diferent files instead just mock out self scenario admin clients with a mock and check for return values as apropriate that s what you wil ned to do once merges anyway that wil also let you get rid of al of the code you aded in fakes py,0
dislike this span10 clas are they necesary and these divs in general,0

stupid question for peter bil vince what does this 20 cfreq mean vco canot be les than 20mhz is this a requirement for al pls,0
this was dumb and obviously never found any bugs i renamed it to pretyprinted to clarify that it does not print anything but merely returns a string the previous overide on the clusterfuz side also just replaced this with a non printing method,0
ignore this i am talking rubish i wil change to datetime,0
it is just an oversight we should clean these up and make our execution consistent,0
afaic it should be in objects cluster,0
it is a litle gros that pthreads had this state for dleror,0

rot pasword should be paslib utils generate pasword size conf default pasword length,0
move this ngdoc down to above function hzinclude,0
you may want to move the cleanup step before the wait conditions because we wil have to delete it anyway,0
so what event is a positional argument of a wel defined api when you test your calback you find that out and fix the damn signature,1
i think you should refactor this into a function kilwithtimeout pid signal then in your code here you would do something like if kilwithtimeout pid sigterm kwaitpidpoltimesforsigterm return true if kilwithtimeout pid sigkil kwaitpidpoltimesforsigkil return true in case of kiling failure log eror timeout waiting for proces pid to be kiled return false,0
the above sems like it would be more apropriate to modify the existing atach block device action than create a new one,0
you are jumping to the destroy workqueue on a non existent wq,0
you can remove has ipv6 from 101 and 104 and here do else kil the daemon if it is runing,0
nit nonexist e nt,0
thanks p draig i wil adres those nits,0
argh i hate these long imports but i was the one who moved the code so it is a beast of my own creation,1
ergh this method is crap then it should raise and not return notimplemented fair enough but it deserves another change for modifying that,1
yes this is stupid fix it right now,0
damn copy paste wrong thing loks god to me,1
why this you only have c code also use std c 1,0
should this be under the live tests section how does runing this compare with runing tpm utility test with use tpm2,0

please use mock instead of mox,0
fuck yeah,1
you already asert the cal count just make side efect raise timeout,0
this extra white space should be removed,0
those sneaky whitespaces,0

sp tx vo state vo wait tx video stable so you can remove this and put the break in the else block above,0
probably those as wel the point it to make sure we get through al the initialization that can fail before sending ok and those lok like things that could fail maybe a beter solution would be to open a pipe before forking the daemon and using that to send the okay instead of stder,0
ignore this brain fart,1

i gues wsa stands for windows suck absolutely i wil remove this code it means we wil just have to live with the code retrying until it dies,1

we are cowardly lions i would prefer to kep the change which causes masive bugs separate from the change to instal this from shil,0
i just have one sugestion to avoid the nested mocks you can try something like this as it aplies to al of your tests with mock patch object self service rbd image exists as mock rbd image exists mock patch self service get restore point as mock get restore point so multiple mocks wil be in the same level instead of several levels,0
ad deprecated use uicontroler getuicard instead,0

we are stil using the native awk on os x which is bsd and does not suport include irc and i am not sure but i believe gnu awk does not build on os x for some stupid reason i never wanted to debug if you can fix that and ensure that each darwin ndk release has a valid prebuilt darwin x86 bin awk program that could work and save some typing,0
i know it might make sense to pre alocate that is a diferent fix again i have eliminated some of the useles kmalocs already this one is not obvious,0

it tok me a month to understand what this code was suposed to do so who is being stupid here first i find out if the destination is 1 cel or a range and if the source area is large than the selected destination area 1271 1279 the largest area of these is taken for the comparisons 1282 1283 as this wil be the actual destination area copy paste some blocks and you wil se what i mean if my text is not clear the first comparison is whether source and destination area overlap 1284 128 when the source area contains references these probably wil go wrong when there is an overlap as this may produce data los e g formulas that get wrong references it must be avoided this code was there from the begining but with erors disabling the wrong options my first patch fixed only a part of that the second comparison 1294 1327 handles something else the question whether shifting the cels in the destination area wil fit on the shet this comparison is not necesary for integrity but for user friendlines without the comparison the user wil get a mesage that the result wil not fit and no harm is done rainer bielefeld wanted the posibilty of fiting on the shet reflected in the en disabling of the shift options i do this check by going from the maxcol maxrow position back for the width height of the destination area and checking if the cels are empty if not paste shift wil not fit and the apropiate shit option is disabled i feared a performance penalty with this method but i tested it on an old slow machine complete build of libreofice takes 24hrs with a destination area almost maxrow high and that gave no noticeable delay but because of this performance penalty danger i want you to have a god lok at the code perhaps it wil be safer to leave it out perhaps there are more eficient ways to check the fiting i hope my proze give you the explanation you want perhaps i should put some of it in the code as coment,1

this previously used a testnavigationobserver but this no longer works for the filesystem url folowing mustafa s r54850 because a top level filesystem url navigation wil be blocked on the renderer side i wanted to kep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem urls so i tried to use waitforloadstop which just exits imediately if a navigation has not started yet however with blob urls that stil did not work because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side so the executescript that sets location above returns before we have received the beginavigation from the renderer hence this ugly extra dumy executescript without it we performed the checks below to early and when getextcontent below did a roundtrip to the renderer we actualy received the beginavigation and created a speculative rfh which caused getrenderframehostsforextension to fail alternatively i could wait for filesystem urls to fail with a console eror similar to what mustafa did on line 18 separately in light of mustafa s change once we are certain that it sticks we might want to kil the renderer if it actualy sends us a beginavigation with a top level filesystem url to handle the compromised renderer case and ad a separate test for that,0

why is this device target id,0
why not just send in opengl alive here and dump it with the other variables,0
is this an in out value that is does it indicate both dest length on input and bytes copied on output if not it does not ned to be a pointer right,0
move it just above self slot to tid to make it clear how about set the default self slot 0 some abnormal self slot to tid self point self presure self syn time none,0
does it own the oat files i asume so then it should be unique ptrs,0
for interactive sesions this is useful as an emergency exit and it matches sh behavior so should not be taken out altogether on older devices piping input wil stil hang even with this cl and puting n at the end can give users a way to close out piped input so it is not totaly useles but if you think it might because problems it sems reasonable to take it out for non interactive inputs,0
meganit alert i wonder if there would be any value in refactoring the block l941 l946 into a function the ned of mocks would stil hurt,0

you are implicitly clearing al w1c bits every time you write this which is bad style you should have a w1c mask that you aply every time you read this register and then explicitly set bits you want to clear before the write,0
i have not tested this so it might be stupid within the scope of a single router we wil not have overlaping ips could it be posible just loading the subnet and verifying whether fip db fixed ip adres fals into the subnet s cidr the advantage would be doing a single query for the subnet instead of a query on ports table for each port,0
god yes that felt stupid,1
this is just a drive by fix of us doing stupid things,1
i am not sure that adres pairs atr not specified should triger a delete of the adres pairs,0
do you want to use an elif for this block,0
translation func should be used,0
this thread is an infinite lop should we kil it at teardown or somewhere else,0
this is unecesary the default oustring ctor already contructs an empty string btw to clear use oustring clear instead of i think there is even a clang plugin that mocks about this in some tinderbox build,0
true but there is not a reason to have crapy mesages either to me string must not be empty is infinitely beter than string must not be at least 1 character s long note that these mesages wil be delivered to the vendor s daemon or client software so having a reasonable mesages loks more profesional in my mind,1
yuck could openjdk have a finalizer to do this instead,1
why is this i think this wil be expand to pid fio dev,0
url should be set for the intent filter folow other examples whether to ad tailing,0

it sems the only valid value is rot else you get 501 yuck but this is corect for now,1

should nuke the whitespace around the operator here,0
it is beter to ad this new target to the list of phony targets phony miror centos,0
this is incredibly ugly i would prefer to wire the scroltoloadlistener directly to the articles section,1
actualy this is incorect this should be pointing at ndk prebuilt host not ndk tolchains host this is for awk and friends,0
i asked for this because i like les coupling with the conf object,0
fix these url s,0
damn sometime i am gona learn english,1
oh lok the stupidity that makes me rant so has already takenrot i suspect it is not to late to fix this and fixing this rates as a mitzvahin my bok,1
kil 0 basicaly validates the pidthat s a smart way to validate a pid i wil update makefile with kil in a separate cl there is another case here though where the master could be dead but the pid is valid and does not belong to the master maybe check the comand line as wel or cwd of the pid fds etc i believe that it should be considered as unhealthy status of twistd for example if make status returns 0 for a proces runing but unhealthy then pupet or most of system management tol would believe that it is not runing and the folowing etc init d buildbot start would fail at the folowing check could also update the above python check function but i believe that the example case you provided should be handled by a separate proces checking for the health of a service the pid is valid and does not belong to the master in other words etc init d status should return runing if a proces is runing for the service either it is healthy or not if make status should not be limited to the usage of etc init d buildbot then i would sugest to have another make target for health checking however once buildbot is migrated to service manager this makefile wil no longer be used,0
this realy should be colapsed down into just log eror le,0
because i am stupid and failed to resolve the merge conflict corectly,0
we should not reintroduce this turd if you ned the c file you ned the defines and vice versa so just remove them from here and the c file,1
oh right damn maybe something like this static const struct pl div apl 180 cfg pl divsors static const struct pl div apl 1392 cfg static const struct pl div apl cfgs apl 180 mhz apl 180 cfg i gues that is geting ugly in other ways again but at least it does not have the raw divisor numbers lying around like that or i gues you could just leave out the aray and switch case it in the code which one you chose could even make it a u32 hz argument instead of an enum then although i am not sure if that would realy be a god thing,1
this should be other requirements sh as it is hardcoded in plugin,0
the pid file here is unecesary and a security risk just have the method return the pid like tracepath tol does,0
sory i was not clear your loging when the remove suceds is god useful i just did not want the nul case as that l get hit alot in normal operations,0
fair enough the right solution would be to wait until cryptohomed actualy dies mind if i post a folow on cl,0
done i went of of media player brige c i wil clean it up when i get rid of mediaplayerandroid,0
this variable names is the name of a variable parse by this codec that is here a list of patern so somethings likes paterns if you just return parser getvariablename this wil be list and that no so stupid,1

after this we wil execute the if body below which wil cal apendrestore,0
you might not have an eror on this write and wil kep the logs cleaner to radzy pointed this out and i think it was a valid sugestion if it keps throwing erors then you end up with an ugly log i think the atempt is valid,0
damn i could have sworn i tested that in the golo but you are right it is not working for me i wil switch it,1
personaly i would change and remove some of the cruft that has crept in over the years i do not think that we ned to bitch about stuf in the past and take our destiny into our own hands,1
abort is safer the compiler can fuck you over here if you ever do ad an enum value but forget to fix the switch,1
gosh that is much beter,0
remove juno it is eoled already,0
ad die,0
i do not think these chars are neded because miror throwable dump ads n to ad the stack trace,0
this is the other thing i do not like about has unlike gnuc prereq they do not cary their own use by date,0
this is not corect a d register can never be through a fpureguster it must be created out of a fpuregisterpair,0
true but al of those clases die in the next cl anyway so i would not wory about the template here,0
why strip chost from minimum gc,0
so are you saying you are not sure we ned it serban,0
given os pci is also the name of the namespace as wel as the alias perhaps it would be clearer to have a diferent dumy value here,0
smal performance optimization instead of geting ref you should use count and if count is 0 raise exception,0
personaly i find the function keyword to be useles noise,0
why do you pop an element you stil just take first one below so it is useles,0
this is a mouthful to make that asignment i think it is making a new observer can this asignement be more direct we should not ned the local ptr cache storage observer makeunique cachestorageobserver getweakptr x getcachestoragecontext,0
could you defer to kil launch unles it is sucesfuly returned,0
this ensures we flush any resize and paint events,0
let us get rid of the goto use destructors to handle cleanup and just early return when you hit a failure,0
there is only a handful of users switch them to static asert and kil the cruft,0
hm to me it sems like the same logic when a combination of any of these are in prof dif updatereplace would hapen alocation id instance id alocation id network interface id eip instance id eip network interface id,0
remove this useles line please,0
loks kind of ugly from code design stand point please align indentation in next line 212 so that the first character is below the first character of prevent,0
right lines are either driven low or floating high so we can only send a stop bit if someone else is not driving the pin aka holding it low so i think we are on the same page,0
there is no existing cranky overlay so you do not ned this blocker delete it,0
uint8 t ptemp src,0
can you explain more about this alternatives how this can work in congres how pupet wil do that,0
damn i usualy catch these,1
rather than doing this and the ugly writel wraper please do something like this static uint32 t grf emcphy con uint32 t 0xf7f780 static uint32 t grf emcphy status uint32 t 0xf7f7a0,1

right however at least i often have some junk files around,0
wrong indentation level two white space righter,0
oh lok someone who was caling hash cleanup listdir with positional args,0
please as docstring to the public methods,0
yep and i would kil the other one with the empty enum type in exchange,0
use patcher for these mocks you have a plenty of methods with such mocks so it is beter to initialize them in setup method,0
worst comit mesage ever please describe what you aded and why you aded it perhaps break your comits up to manageable hunks with git ad p,0
edit node interface s scren,0
yeah anoyingly we curently have a mix since these realy belong in strings h i just copied them acros one day we should just remove al the extern s,0
probably should use something other than the dumy validator,0
this cl makes al the tests hermetic and no longer ned to modify files on disk so removes pythonpath crap and temporarymasterpaswords,1
please use docker py 1 0 0 rather then a hard pin,0
in general hardcoding tmp paths is a bad idea especialy when you consider is a pid and pid namespaces make colisions much easieryou can do something simple like trap rm f tmpfile exit readonly tmpfile mktemp,0
but can we leave it stupid for now for the sake of geting it going,1
s mesage calback mesage calbacks why is this a naked type while we have typedefs for eventypestrings and subscribedevents,0
loks like you are mising a newline here,0

use cros build lib die to do the print exit,0
this docstring neds to be revised you can just say do nothing here,0
for regex paterns always do r in your case r s s data vendor id data product id meanwhile 0 9 is equivalent to match any char the 0 9 is useles here because overides it what is the real patern you want to match here in sys bus hid devices there are directories with names like 03 06cb 2393 01 i am just trying to lok up the one which contains the vid and pid which genericinput found you may have noticed i do not write a lot of python what i have sems to work but i am sure it is not the best way to do it,0
resp is a tuple and i thinks it can never be none,0
damned right,1
internal parens are unecesary,0

you must have not sen my coments before you comited yours refresh your browser to se my notes it was just a sily mistake,1
ah thanks for the clarification,0
this way of patching is a bit dirty because if we want to change how the client works then we have to patch your writer to,0
out header,0
remove the such as i think this has led people to read things into it that they shouldn t and if you care about what is in it you ned to be using getbestdate,0
i do not know why it was named cofe pot probably due to the name of the project but if you tel me i would be glad to ad it name of device should not be unique,0
1 it does not hurt2 it should fail to3 the eror handing in this driver is atrocious we should realy fix it up i think the right thing to do is to propagate the eror up and fail out of everything chosing conf 0 wil likely not result in the desired behavior anyways 4 gerit s handing of line breaks suck,1
kil the extra spaces,0
canot this be done as a decorator stil it should be executed on cal se,0

made this into an enum lmk if you have beter ideas for the name,0
asert buildid nul codebase nul and remove the if below,0
not 1 over this but it sems like we could turn a lot of these functions into a comon function also the mocks could be puled out into reusable mocks,0
it should be moved into taskmanager,0

ah heh that does something perhaps unexpected in a non const environment cow wraper get wil make the impl object unique this is not what hapens in the original code but this entire setup is but ugly anyway i sugest to write thre methods for the thre cals from outside this clas gives much beter control about what actualy hapens with the impl ptr,1
and ned to handle situation when request contains incorect body name or release id are mised name is incorect value release id is incorect value empty body,0

ugly but nice bandaid,1
1 3 se earlier coments about fidling w the patch multiple times leading to the curent el busto d form to get gerit to actualy take the cl emails already sent to pul the gerit logs and run down that cause 2 yeah i am a moron that was there prior to the gerit mayhem 4 this pathway in general for this is wrong including prior to my changes it would alow throwing out a newer version of a dep during this falback testing being inacurate frankly not particularly sure if it is even worth maintaining the you should update to tot vs patch conflict bits the conflict detection handling realy realy is at the wrong layer here sorely tempted to rip it out unles someone thinks it is worth keping which case it would have to be at the validation pol layer,1

hang on thats rubish ignore that idea i kinda think if we want conf image cache subdirectory name to mean the same for vmware and libvirt if posible if we aded a conf vmware make cache folder unique that controled if you ad the my ip to the conf image cache subdirectory name it would be much simpler admins that want to share the folder then just set conf vmware make cache folder unique false then they configure the cache directly just like libvirt folks by configuring conf image cache subdirectory name,0

if extract thread list is enabled it splits the raw data and the ps dump as wel as the procfs dump previously it returned just the raw data and the mapings from pid to cmdline i went ahead and modified it so it returned the rest of the text dump as wel which contains our proc dump and any future dumps that get aded later any future text dumps wil have to implement two cases either extraxt cmdline extracts the raw data or it doesn t then it gets pased to extract tgid which wil either extract the raw data or it wont as you can se this is going to get cumbersome i wil fix this now and have the raw data be extracted before any sort of text extraction hapens not sure why this was not done in the first case,0

a 404 however would make sense is resource did not exist there are cases like you know neutron when you get a 404 because a resource does not exist whereas the truth is that the resource does not exist on that specific instance of the server because the extensions that implements it is not defined this was a place were some idiot me proposed initialy we should instead use the 501 i justified myself saying i was talking about jeans from a famous brand i think 40 is the only one that makes some sense however as a side note i think you to are aware that we are using 40 for quite a lot of stuf and the only way of distinguishing the various erors is the mesage mesages are god for humans not so for machines are we stil completely 2 on the idea of sending aplication eror codes within eror response bodies,0

yeah that sems sily the macro name is almost as long as the inline text and it encourages you to use the bad form that does not include a mesage not sure what they were thinking there,0
i have a couple of concerns here the most minor one is that this now forces us to use this decorator only on instance or clas methods is there anywhere where this is not the case the second concern is that if i recal corectly the get context from function and args function was created because the decorator was used on some methods where context had to be searched for which argues that for those methods it is not the first non self argument to the method this means that for those methods this could result in a notify stil containing the context but mising the first argument to the method which may be rather useful also it is worth pointing out that there are no other consumers of get context from function and args it is used in nova openstack comon notifier api py but the version used is of course from nova openstack comon context py given that this patch should probably also remove the function asuming my two concerns above are not a factor,0
do you have already a potential fix from what you describe here i do not se a way out if we ned to kil overlaping ips maybe let us just do that,0

fs unmaped should be fs inst maped right,0
how is memcpy more endian friendly in this case you are never acesing any of the bytes directly you are just dereferencing a 4 byte opaque ptr and pasing it as on opaque 4 byte blob to ntohl in the function cal below you never perform bit byte operations on it until then so memcpy is superfluous here the only benefit to using memcpy here is that it is safer on platforms with hard alignment restrictions as x could be unaligned here so for that purpose we should leave the memcpy not for endianes,0

you might have a race condition here you probably want to disable the users first and foremost before doing anything else a user could potentialy be loged in and creating tokens and credentials while you are deleting them and you could end up with one hanging around after you thought yoyu had removed them al this is non transactional after al,0
i believe that you mean bashrc,0

beter to describe what it does rather than why it is here the why can be found in the comit mesage git blame it does not hurt to much to include it here although it may sufer from coment rot,0
hm i wil se this code started of as a straight port from the bash which is why there is globals like this i think i wil kil of the testing arg completely once i am hapy this code actualy works and the unitests give god coverage it should actualy already so in light of this being destined for death i am not sure i want to bother with this restructure if i planed on keping it i would def agre with your clas object aproach,0
because if we start from the rot we wil break fk of parent id i wil mention it in the coment,0

removing wil break some users of ironic ironic stil works without the clusteredcomputemanager cm alows for beter scaling and ha as we only suport one compute host it is bugy as heck to instance action races this work wil alow us to kil that of,0
i would rather have the mlock in the individual methods rather than here,0
that kind of conflict resolution should make this a backport,0

nulptr,0
hm how do you create gems without a gem creation ioctl only dumb gems,0
i would have to ad another library to the pdk this is anoying,1
get vioses is not tested anywhere i actualy think it would have ben beter if you had kept the mocks of vios get,0
d oh that is awful english on my part fixing,0
this should be i18n or at least androidimportprojectaction wizard title should be used,0
you can use asertin and asertnotin,0
is this realy the right place this sems like an awful hack,1
ops i am an idiot and canot read it is not actualy published,0
these s should be lined up,0
jesus you are starting to make me think i have a brain tumor,1

struct completion arb cnt complete tegra rpc max sem,0
can drop the die,0
that would force me into wraping ioexception not worth the trouble,0
i think i am mising something here but i do not know this code at al wal so sory for the dumb questsion if we falback to the integration bridge i would have expected to se this tried first then if not found atempt to lok up the integration bridge,0
actualy i canot do this one in this review because the interface requires a name not a ful instance which is stupid,1
why have this line self asignment api get domain domain id when you have the same cal just storing the return value next domain ref self asignment api get domain domain id,0
can you test without these special run bindmounts the above run run should pul in the entire run filesystem including run lvm and run lvmetad pid,0
you mis an unitest with host fakehost,0
it should be versioned as in methods below,0
ocd here but why the heck is there extra spaces in front of your copy right,0
al of this was specific to comandexecuteimpl and should be removed,0
i think the cleanest style here would be to make this clas linker iscompiledimagemethod m and then embed maybe into claslinker as iscompiledimagemethod it would be nice to avoid exposing the debuger to iner notions of oat files,0
i wil remove this in the next upload i hate it when i se something to change after i have already aded a coment in gerit,0
removes this crap from bionic s grp h,1
except it is not a bolean it is the string of files to ignore e g cvs git svn fo,0
should this be ifneq findstring mips target arch,0
why is this removed i think there is some crap in the virt drivers that keys of whether or not the properties key is in the image meta but i would have to dig to confirm later wel i dug and we have a bunch of code that is just doing image meta properties so aparently it is not a problem else we would be keyeror crazy i am just not sure why the change is here related,1
why is this key name and not keyname as in instance py,0
you are not folowing because i am not making sense my argument was based on future code superimposed onto this function i wil use your sugestion in the next version it s late i ned to quit before i say more dumb things,0
in the no wake i think logicaly this neds to be int ehw wake signal group,0
ok i get why you have got those print statements in there kil them and invoke the test with v it wil give you beter output making those prints unecesary for debuging development of these unitests frankly unitest runer s default of being stupidly quiet is obnoxious,0
nit these two temporaries do not ad much value,0
burn the wit h h htab,0
literal as,1
i hate console programs eating random characters on my terminal but that is a question of personal taste,0
this limiter should be removed,0
run the folowing comand to instal virtualenv as instal venv py is not packaged run tempest sh u not exist tests,0

prefer you use delete key as there is already a delete group delete host etc,0
i have just learned that i told a stupid thing yes i wil change this to wait thanks for this catch,0
ah god point but it suck to have the cut and paste hm geting the values for these configs from the oslo ones sems crazy to i gues this could work as it is if we have to,1

self group configuration self launch configuration,0
i would rather se this parameter removed there is only one option so it is useles anyway,0
pid 0 is legitimate getcon or setcon cal and why do we ned this separate check when you already handle this in openatr why canot we leave getprocatrcon and setprocatrcon unchanged and only deal with this in openatr,0
se you in hel comon h,1
node start is now caled automaticaly inside the constructor so it is unecesary i wil delete it node stop and node start are caled in the destructor for symetry by itself that does not isolate the tests because the destructors do not necesarily get caled imediately only when garbage colected separate patch that isolates the tests from each other,0
container pid is not a child of sesion manager so iuc this wil never be true do not you ned to compare pid to run oci pid,0
huh is there a cmp equivalent to that would let us kil cmp exe not that i want to distract you and ad things to the critical path but just thinking longer term,0
one last posibly stupid question are caler and owner limitation the same value here they both sem to pul x target id from header,0
that shit is unfortunately required when next buton gets display none the focus returns to body not to modal modal stops to get keyboard events beter solution,1
use die,0
tbh i sort of think this makes the notification agent to dumb,0

done yes those setings can be derived by executing syncontrol diag,0
irc it made for a ridiculously long line that then had to be broken in very ugly ways to pas pep8,1
can you put al this stuf somewhere outside pytest like factory py locale py goftol has a separate copy of this and it would be nice to consolidate later if you do that the remaining tasks are smal enough that you could just put them into vpd py of course we should realy find a way to reuse chromeos s l10n libraries but i wil not make you do that here,0
nit we ned to kil first remove avoids first person and the unclear word kil plus shorter,0
scrow instead of sal uint16 if not scrow then at least a 32bit type,0
wel that was sily of me,1
this is not realy god form because if someone implements these methods for kitkat one they wil not know there is this corner case that does not work probably beter to pas in the bol in the lolipop and higher constructor instead then if someone wants to use atached state in kitkat one at least they wil realize the initial value is mising and then fix tracking properly that does mean inlining webcontentsacesibility create here though which kind of suck or maybe it is easier to just put a coment in the kitkat one that mentions this corner case,1
these mojom enums should live in storage comon quota to,0
liar you want 2018,1
you could just delete these vars since they are empty,0
it should work i confirmed that the folowing comand worked ipmitol v i lanplus h host l administrator u id p pw sol activate,0
this should have ben const void i understand that it stems out from curl s calback which stupidly does not use const maybe have this function be nice,1
we do not ned to cal colect au log in the first place if log dir is mising why do not just let colect au log to check any parameter it gets in that kind of implicit handling is bad it is how you end up with javascript 5 3 2 weak typing implicit conversions headaches 5 3 53 because we al love consistency 5 4 1 string string integer what 5 5 5 fo fo fonan marvelous 5 2 5 2 5 2 52 aparently it is ok var x 3 5 x x 50 5 x x 5 because fuck math,1
oh sry the actualy line is mock cal bind admin mock deployment get return value admin users,0
is not the client always linux hm client is a terible name i have no idea what i am loking at here i was planing on moving those files that curently have client in the name there it sems to mean device usb linux client is the device side code usb linux is the host side code likewise adb auth adb client cp does not fit this patern though it is a mixture and for file sync client is the host and service is the device,0
nits as long as you are here might as wel remove this extra space and align the rest of the below with the above,0
yeah that sounds right anchor node should be weakmember frame should be member,0
why side efect i think it is beter to use return value e g self wraped keystone create user return value user list,0
cpickle wil perform beter import cpickle as pickle,0
this loks od you might write it like this instead to clean it up a bit from setuptols comand sdist import sdist sdist run self,0
i wil take a stab at rewording this,0
this function is useles since you would have to first convert your input to a dict first,0
return 0 on suces and use int please,0
instancenotfound should be catched explicitly,0
this function may be more readable if there were coments with examples of what the expected inputs lok like,0
btw ecmascript6 significantly increases bundle size by ading dozens jscomp variables like const jscomp async this this return jscomp asyncexecutepromisegeneratorfunction and es6 polyfils it is awful,1
based on the old version it loks like lxc should be built even if use daemon is not sent so how about this cros go binaries ego pn lxc if use daemon then cros go binaries ego pn lxd ego pn fuidshift fi,0
actualy it should be snapshotnotfound which like shareresourcenotfound is a subclas of storageresourcenotfound,0
you should kil is checked now,1
ful listing ned to be set to false it is overide limit and get al containers,0
awful hack inserted,1
write should be write to be consistent with the bulets above,0
ew does it have to be a uint32 t,1
i think a listopt might be easier to manage than having to concatenate several regexes in one string,0
also loks like you can just get rid of mapsize and use page size instead,0
this should be moved to test hostops py as we are trying to completely remove test hypervapi py,0
do you realy mean to pas this string by value my inclination would have ben const std string method name,0
oh derp now that you have pointed out that is obvious i was thinking for a while how this should be indented eh wod for the tres and al that,1
put it inside ifdef suport checksum,0
yes i mean test create instance is caled only with vnuma enabled false i did not find other usages like test create instance vnuma enabled true,0
sahid s coment sems reasonable,0
actualy the info was duplicated here as exception dump would dump the location,0
drop the die,0
i do not like this you are partialy parametrizing the test along a diferent dimension variable in a nested for lop i se two options write out every single case as a separate dumb test or parametrize properly i sugested parametrization due to the shape of the problem you are just testing cases in the cartesian product of various sets of dimensions web logdir build x short long x true false web logdir build x short long x servo firmware this is the worst of both worlds you are copy pasting the test acros web logdir build and parametrizing acros short long x server firmware you are paying the complexity price for the parametrization while stil keping some duplication that the parametrization is suposed to remove,0
if you are aproving my coment on the context you do not ned this which is quite ugly imho,1
ad your own s o b line below the others please,0

it is the idea we want to monitor infinitely for proc pid to die,0
please ad tests for get nic interfaces for al nodes get bond interfaces for al nodes,0
ya trying to remember why i did not do that think the reason was because i canot realy ad docstrings to that it generates some of it is own that are crap and the docstrings are somewhat useful here,1
heh must have had your head phones on this morning while david and i were debating why del sucked and should not be used i stil posit it is a language fault rather than implementation in loking at this i get the strong feling the del is required a todo stating rebase to snakeoil weakrefs weakrefinalizer would be wise,1
should we be concerned about integer overflow here,0
i honestly hate his block of conditionals and i am prety sure it wil take revenge on us soner or later but hey welcome to bash,1
what about one that has a subclas that it returns this is checked in your duck typing proxy at least,1
maybe a stupid question but why swaping nxadvance and nyadvance does not do the trick more to the point if nxadvance is wrong in this case how come nyadvance is right,0
nit why not just write hostinfo fakes fakehoststate host1 node1 if you have to update the patch how about we simple it,0
sory about that that was a dumb move on my part i wil fix on the next revision,0
put the trailing space outside of trans please it is eror prone for the translators and does not even have any meaning when translating,0

this line should be removed,0
nit mesage should be oauth1 is disabled,0
you probably want to protect this with ifdef cplusplus,0
security bug we can not alow log id kernel through this or the logd socket interface as klogd is an internal daemon that is part of logd revisit as this should be fixed and institutionalized in the liblog writer reader and within logd itself we wil not fix it in the context of this cl,0
pep8 pyflakes and flake8 should be removed here se my coments in other patches,0
you have already set new tgt name tgt alias on l 292,0
i would cal this something likeincludingdebugsymbols vs real unles this somehow relates to your fake stuf,0

fake port id fake show data interfaceatachment port id,0
equal to oustring has to be removed,0
ick resource data is such a nasty internal hack not as nasty as what we used to do with metadata of course but stil is there any way we can not expose this to the user if we just disalowed external reference for resource types that have resource data most of which do not even have a sensible external resource id anyway do we have an idea of what might be afected,1

1 is to far from real life put at least 5,0
oh hels yes to that i hate those strings,1
how about just return job jobstate in self completed job states,0
wel your code is explicitly validating that the value pases through that s what these tests are for thus it does mater a bit not likely to bite us in the as but should be dealt with,1
er then you ned to dump them do not you otherwise the user hit a failure and there is no way to find out what it was,0
just moved from another file and i stand by my naming damnit,1
switched away from calbacks se coment mesage,0

now al trh get usages were eliminated in this cl done,0
gfx kplaceholdercolor instead of black then you probably do not ned the coment,0
the folowing mocks are not used and should be removed from the test mock open mock copy mock rmtre mock file mock dump mock json load mock random name,0
use a set from the begining so that you can remove this ugly hack,1
yes if that one fails we have already a corupt calc model and it would just crash later,0
they are actualy no longer used they were going to be used in the gradle build file but re architecting made them obsolete,0
maybe make this a subroutine caled something like setcurentvalue,0
curent user must have permision to run kvm vms with libvirt,0
you can probably remove this last sentence,0
base vendor id or at the very least hamer vendor id,0
do you think we should as this to basetestcase i se that this wil be repeated for every controler,0
unfortunately this wil not be suficient we ned to use gtest config libs and gmock config libs since both of those suck and do not provide a pc file i gues we wil have to ad a new key here like config libs that l execute 1 config libs like it does for pkg config,1
consider objects tostringhelper,0
talked with peria san ofline in short i am not hapy with this hack i would rather prefer changing removing dcheck in threadstate runterminationgc,0
drop the die cals,0

as is reserved for as a service so i gues you wil have to use as here,0
i am fine with it either way i just think ksmatchers is an ugly name and canot think of a beter one so would be nice to only have matchers,1
maybe ad a coment here reminding the reader what the empty sid is about,0
coment stil has awful english please fix,1
i hate die if we e here and runing code we ned to do something beter or when building catch it there,1

it sems like the fundamental isue here is that adb socket acept does not set erno if fh aloc fails maybe consider fixing that and then kil the erno checking in this func sory i should fixed adb socket acept myself when i last touched it,0
this terminationflag is somewhat ugly global variables are always ugly,1
the false is arbitrary and non obvious specify it as a kwarg e g catalog false,0
you are creating a list of snapshot objects not a snapshots object,0
dumb idea but maybe we can set the id here to be the id of the cfg conf nsx v3 dhcp profile uid say someone wants to query al of the neutron ports asigned to this profile,0
please use self loger eror instead of print,0
bah no service id for templated eh yay crapy pycadf audits,1

maundotext matext getstr should avoid teh alocation of a temp copy of oustring trigered by tostring although ti probably would be cleaner to ad an overloadof to suport oustring oustringbufer directly,0
just out of curiosity why this could not be in the destructor might be a stupid question but i do not work to much with c,0
nit you caled it amt mgmt in fake py or use amt management to be consistent with the other management here,0
label is useles,0
darn braile captions already tok a b,1

no action required talk about a useles test name,0
we do not have the u of crud here,0
because this patch purpose is to retry sh conecting to a server with pasword and get a public key from the server this problem would be related to public private keys because of the eror mesage and i would like to confirm their keys are valid or invalid as the first step for it i ned to conect to server without private key i know this code is not smart and it would not be merged permanently this code should be just for debuging,0
i am stil going to unset it if you clean up as you go as this code does that makes it more robust should someone ever gut the subsheling it is the same reason we use functions in code which this should be in hindsight it s unlikely this wil ever bite us in the as but i would rather this code be defensive than be stucking debuging it down the line,1
use self msg,0

could you please make it a clas instead it is already cp and it is used only in c files why do we ned to stick to ugly c interface,0
same reasoning given for gerithelper init when doing default arguments falbacks like this one neds to be extremely explicit in the check else you can get bit in the as prety easily consider the folowing prototype def dosomestuf myargs cache overide none if not cache overide cache overide self internal cache self realydostuf myargs cache overide it s subtle but that block of code wil incorectly falback to the internal cache if the pased in cache overide is which may be entirely intentional to force a run w out using internal caches values if you use the is none check it handles it corectly the only as biter in scenarios like that is when you ned to detect if none was explicitly pased in in which case you use an object singleton to detect it,1

ack i am not sure maybe proces reuse should also be forbiden in case of tab discarding in this case combining the flags might make sense otoh this would also work with separate bol enum maybe one alternative would be to put the bol enum into a shared struct i do not know,0
this suck a bit here but we required the spec to be god enough to document the feature as such i am afraid you ned to specify how you configure this feature i asume you would have some entry points for the diferent drivers including the nop driver and you pick them and each driver might have it is own nova conf section with extra setings maybe ned to list the ones you are implementing here x509 tls one,1

this is horibly ineficient it copies each parameter twice also when inserting many items it is much much much faster to do setrowcount and fil in the rows one also neds to block signals to make it event fasterin the end if there is so much data that even setrowcount is slow split the data into batches and insert using incremental setrowcount snow it is ridiculously slow as qt realocates and redraws way to often,1
sory for not being clear i was only refering to grep exe part of the comand other stuf sems fine also you do not ned the kil sh script maybe you can just do something like comands below it loks cleaner imo pid ps ef grep htpsrv grep v grep awk print 1 echo kiling htpsrv pid kil 9 pid,0

right i tried by pasing in procesmemory here instead since that has a base derived structure thinking that on mac linux android and fuchsia we only used proces reader memory below and that that could be treated as a base procesmemory but 1 memory is a taskmemory on mac and 2 i did not lok at the body of mergewithothersnapshotimpl which is a friend and it uses proces reader and neds the real type and 3 fuchsia did not actualy have a memory method anyway though that one is adable i could probably share fuchsia s with linux s but it would stil ned to be a template then to handle procesreader so it semed les worthwhile since shoving it al in the header sort of suck i also could not think of a name for the template memorysnapshotlinuxandroidfuchsia is not exactly prety the rename of procesreader procesreaderwhatever was mostly because i it does not work as wel for grep tags though we would stil have proces reader members though so there would stil be some of that problem,1

god question that was a real head scratcher for me it loks very specific so i did not want to change it even though i agre we should probably clean up on any exception sounds like both of you would be in favor of that change and me would make thre so i wil fix that up,0

this can also make some other thread spuriously start registering as the main thread it also only fols one check but many other things stil lok like it is the main thread like tls and what the fuck maynotbemainthread so this is a very limited ilusion if it is just for your particular tests maybe your code could provide it is own bypas named ismainthreadortest or something that can be overiden idealy though we would actualy run it of the main thread since if the code cares about threading we should probably test how it deals with threading this also sems like it would give tsan a beter oportunity to detect bugs,0

self remote device devserver bin static dir none kwargs,0
these new mocks sem to be overly broad my understanding of this is that any object using time time not just the monasca comon kafka producer wil be efected by this mock is that your understanding if it is then this may work in the curent case but sems dangerous for future development i would prefer to mock as specificaly as posible to avoid unintentionaly disabling functionality in objects,0

ugh damnit the second should be fp ofset fixing thanks,1
let me be clearer 1 the legacy behaviour i e the one that the android libc so always exposed through it is publicly visible atexit is broken i e the coresponding handlers are never caled when a library is unloaded this may result in resource leaks but at least no crash this may result in a crash when the aplication exits but many never cal exit and are simply automaticaly kiled by the system 2 there is existing native code here that is probably bugy but just hapens to work due to 1 and some of this code is never going to be recompiled if it were it would be against a newer ndk and the new code would not have this problem 3 your patch changes the system s behaviour for this legacy code the end result is not predictable and may results in crashes we do not want to this chance in other words the risks benefit ratio for this patch is just to damn high,1

i do not actualy think that makes sense if we do not time the creation of the routers and plumbing them to the subnets what use would the benchmark be if we wrap the router creation and plumbing in a single timer then the benchmark canot tel you which of those actions is more time consuming and if we wrap the entire router creation plumbing lop in an atomic action then that timer is just plain useles if the results are to ugly then set subnets per network to 1 and they get a lot les ugly aside from doing that there are realy no sets of actions in this scenario that can be meaningfuly combined into a single timer,0

it loks like git clone just recursively hardlinks everything under git objects,0
force makes sense in a comand like cros mark as stable p fo bar comit forcebut does not make much sense if you say cros mark as stable al comit forcethis becomes evident by the fact that your bolean in the lib is alow blacklisted and not force i d prefer to not permit the option al and force in the same comand as that is something you certainly do not want you should always specify p if you use force,0

these various ideas al sem to have a built in race condition i am not sure which idea is least likely to because a problem for example if a query for cpu on one of the created servers is done before and after the upgrade ods are that before the upgrade there wil be no results because the polster has not run however that is not guaranted similarly if a query is done for instance it is unlikely but not imposible that some data after the upgrade wil come from notifications and some from poling therefore i ned the answer to two questions how can i form a query that says only give me poling data for meter x how can i form a query that says only give me results after the upgrade is there metadata that wil alow filters on that for the sake on concision and quick resolution pretend a that i am an idiot b the query docs suck,1

it sems a bit sily to go from a stringpiece to a std string to a webstring to a what the fuck string can we skip some of those conversions i think you should just be able to create a what the fuck string directly pasing in data size from the string piece,1

it is super ugly to mes with a boting state in a function that sets the baudrate also with the later clear bit you overwrite the the value set during initialization shutdown which might not be intended and clearly is not easy to folow i think it is preferable to make sure the flag is set when the function is caled,1

using data 0 was my first idea but we would either ned to drop const from the parameter list and dirty the interface as eliot comented or use a const cast which is prety ugly besides we probably should not be making raw changes to a std string in the first place a std vector char could have worked beter here or wraping the strdup with std unique ptr but hopefuly we wil get rid of this copying once and for al with,0
is this realy iomem or is is just sram se,0

we had long lines for names before and personaly i dislike split string literals especialy when there are no spaces i wil se what does not lok horible,1
i find this coment a bit confusing the proxy does not own the delegate in fact it is usualy the delegate that ends up owning the proxy if you change it to a const reference then al interface methods wil ned to be const,0
i do not get it does not the tuple being built here end up the same as the one in neutron lib why not just use the one from neutron lib this loks prety ugly would not you get the same thing from router interface owners lib constants router interface owners router interface owners snat lib constants router interfaces owners snat,1
damn you and your relevant nits,1

this paren is redundant,0
you should close the inputjacklibrary first you should stil close the vfs after in case the instantiation of the lib failed,0
yeah it suck a bit,1
not oposed but the syntax of this is kinda brutal makes me wonder if the fraction of a second savings are realy worth it given the scripts usualy run for minutes also could this be made global and reused for the same thing below,0

brian you are right let me remove the get metric names and get metrics method,0
i do not think it makes any sense to divide elfutils up like this it does not help anyone only perf and ltrace use elfutils and they ned most of the libraries we re actualy fucking this up anyway because libebl tries to dlopen libebl arch and we are not building those libraries yet we get away with it because the caler is useles on the target anyway and picks up the os libraries on the host but we should fix that at which point this probably wil not build with clang,1
gerit did not catch the git mv so anoying,1
this is kind of smely what if calback is never caled for whatever reason we wil leak the object anyway this is not a question for you but this code is terible,1

what lutz said the first isue data structure of wrong type could hapen due to an admin mesing around with their low level preg pol files or perhaps due to backwards incompatible change to a policy schema don t do this the second isue malformed json strings wil hapen al the time when admins forget a curly brace i do not think it is necesary to tel the admin both at once somehow you corupted your pol file and also you forgot a curly brace,0
i can make the registration code clear the pco value when not registered and set it to the previous non empty value when it gets registered again we can basicaly always update the pco value using the testing interface testing py and kep the value around do you ned an api to set the action value specificaly i e not the entire string just the action value if so which character s corespond to it also are these values carier specific if they are then let us make the pseudom dumb and always use an explicitly set value through m1 i testing,0

the else branch here is usualy where we execute native plexi actions i e actions that are implemented in the plexi libraries but the way the rest of the driver is writen that is hard to do right they import 10 diferent clases afinitygroup job physicalport plexiswitch each of which has actions that could be executed so the else branch here is not going to work i would probably get the bug fixed first and then think about whether it is worth exposing al the native plexi actions so you could get away without the else branch here and leave a todo saying something like what i explained above,0

i am a bit concerned about the implementation here if you say that the same tag can be asociated to multiple resources and that the same resource is asociated to multiple tags this is not the right way to model this logicaly otherwise you wil end up having lots of duplicated and a non normalized schema say for instance that i want to tag my networks with golden i would ned to have lots of entries like so 1 golden my golden tag network net 1 2 golden my golden tag network net 2 3 golden my golden tag network net 3 4 golden my golden tag network net 4 this is a waste from a number of perspectives from storage lokup and cascading efects instead you should have a tag table tag description where tag is key and a maping table tag id resource type resource id this stil suck though because now you canot enforce the foreign key constraint on resource id i e if a resource gets deleted now you gota enforce the delete on cascade via programing logic which is yucky ultimately we would ned to have a maping table for resource i know it is more work but that gives you the most leverage of the dbms capabilies,1

oh i realized the lack of what the fuck crosthreadbindrepeating but i originaly thought what the fuck crosthreadbind was smart enough to handle both once and repeating cases if not then i believe it makes sense to ad what the fuck crosthreadbindrepeating i can mock something up,0
lazy brilo flag helpers does not provide define uint32,0
wow elif should be removed at al with todo coment as it is now it skips al extra fk that was found,0
nit you are inside the dwarf namespace so you do not ned these,0
just a minor nit that since module nul if initwraper has ben caled you do not ned the aditional bol first,0
i would rather make this something like sal unicode clastchar 0 sal int32 npos atext getlength 1 while npos 0 clastchar atext npos 0x20 npos so we catch any number of trailing spaces and also do not atempt to aces atext out of bounds,0

ryan krot corected me on this nul means there was no eku not an eku with no oids a malformed eku such as that should throw certificateparsingexception when we lokup ekuoids,0
this presumes that it ends in bz2 canot we just strip of the extension dest basename basename rpartition 0,0
should we remove detectvalueboundfromvalue and inline the code here sems like valuebound create and valuebound detectvalueboundfromvalue are redundant,0
the docstring is self evident remove,0

declare this as welcomebubleview and remove the static cast in getclosebutonfortest,0
dev dbg or preferably just kil this,0
yeah this is sily iscrenon does not necesarily mean what you think it means what if there were multiple screns you should be stoping progres from onpause instead the activitymanager wil take care of pausing activities when the device goes to slep,0
use an enum clas here so the enum values do not corupt the namespace,0
btw we realy suck at naming consistency camelcase versus underscores this loks god to me though,1
grep for am cpflags n and remove al those,0

awful use query soft delete take a lok at migration,1
expect eq can now print gfx rect when failed so you can just use gfx rect,0
i did some testing with al 3 types of urls username query and port and they al stil work it sems libsmbclient just ignores them since i am stil able to mount with arbitrary values random port numbers users and queries do we stil want to reject al thre of these,0
like you said a dumy sync sesions client just moves the problem around i l ad some more dchecks below like you sugested,0
svx is even worse that is a cyclic dependency,0
could you name this something that indicates it concatenates the suplied keymanagers with the defaults maybe something lame like createwithaditionalkeymanagers,0
ha yeah that is a bit sily i can remove that one,1
do not ned return here,0
nit stil a bit clumsy this maybe use the subtre term that we use when creating the asignment above e g the list only contains those role asignments anchored to this project that were specified as being inherited to it is subtre,1
this is a subset of code bin header v1 flcn perhaps you can reuse the header,0
adbcomandfailederor is a subclas of comandfailederor so i think that is ok,0
ok to do what you are requesting use a diferent name means we would wind up with the content in two diferent vars or i would have to split a base clas then derive the git repo targeting one then target the manifest checkout one which would be a pointles pain in the as what was done here works fine and is sane inheritance op more importantly sane pythonic behaviour path means the path that this clas works on it says nothing about what that path is intentionaly so since it is dependent on the clas i m not going to change it basicaly if you fel strongly enough 2 it else register disproval via 1 if others agre they wil load up if they disagre the 2 and 1 are perfectly fine wil not be ofended anoyed,1
i know kil is a very bad system cal name in posix but can we ad some information as a coment or at least in the docstring saying that this kil cal with the argument 0 wil not try to kil the proces just saying because it is confusing to cal os kil to check the proces and after that cal kil using utils execute to actualy kil the proces or another way simpler to check it for the existence of the proces would be to check the proc fs e g def check pid pid check for the existence of a pid return os path exists proc d pid,0
do we have anything to prevent things like bin sh,0
just noticed that this function has nothing to do with the dma buf api and that you are stil replacing the dumb map with the dma buf map module i think it would be best to kep both around for now,0
do not you mean kargo kult,0
ha true i am an idiot,0
something loke restart count would be more informative,0
nit maybe cal these alocations before and alocations after,0
could also use self proces send signal i am not sure what the diference is or if sigterm or sigkil is okay self proces terminate self proces kil,0
one of my admitedly low impact dreams is to kil libc static one day progres,0
seking fedback here re whether the visual rect is in the right space for it is use here,0
it would be beter to validate it on seting it perhaps kiling the renderer for sending a bad one,0

this is ugly hopefuly with our pstylefamilyentries it wil not be necesary,1
i think that this note should be removed,0
this might be cleaner without p perhaps something like adr msgs 0 buf 0 block adr edid length buf msgs 1 buf,0
i would prefer we used the stupid atomic uint least32 t here so we can use explicitly sized types in the rest of the code alowing 1970s nonsense like unsigned int to leak back into the code sems like a mistake even if the il considered standard tries to move us in that direction,0
get everything cache the results and filter them afterwards based on isue entity s last updated field,0

why the flip flop here in the parent cl this is eror,0
i might be dumb but i do not get where the 63 comes from,0
to be fair it is even more mad that you were returning something from decode that does not suport being decoded i did not say you could not use binary object if you wanted to just that opcode as an interface was pointles i change binary decode because i want to be able to suport compatibility shims that can decode old data but not re encode it makes total sense also given that i changed it a while ago there is not a single ocurence of a cast in our code base and you have not even noticed let alone ben badly afected by it i stand by the decision,0
you should do something like eq 3 die,0
why we are doing this only if ret s kitchenargs logdogflags anotationurl iszero abovei think we should do it unconditionaly,0
items shown items,0
al these are posible i think to declare the stage suceded in al devservers we wil have to get a definitive response from each devserver any htperor could be indicating some eror worth to dig into,0
nit this is enough values that i wonder if it would be cleaner to kep these puled into another object const responsecokiemodification cokie modifiers for auto modification cokie modifiers,0
should not ned this mock since there is a fixture that mocks it instead try self apt read return value resp,0
done git cl format just got more anoying to use on linux because it loks for gn that is not present in angle this means the formating has to be done in the chromium checkout or i have to create an ugly symlink s,0
this also neds another retval check to abort if we have 10 failures,0
actualy getfoundaraylength returns haraylength so this is not neded at one point in my change getfoundaraylength returns hinstruction but not anymore,0

it is not that i was ignoring identity it was that i forgot that people could pas in stupid stuf like non functions,1
we send 10x kil 9 to proces in while lop why send one more we should return ocf er generic here if kil 9 not kiled our proces pacemaker should move resource to unmanaged stonith should kil node in curent aproach we wil hide problem from pacemaker user which can lead to strange galera behavior data los but this dosent mean that problem disapears,0
ah yes it wil and we wil end up retrying it max provision retries times,0
er you were right i meant for it only to afect config samsung pm debug but screwed that up if we move the cal to your sugested location that fixes it,0
i think you are suposed to use include external stlport libstlport mk,0
it is b zier not bezi r but if this coment is to pedantic you can probably just leave out the french diacritic,1

oh i se you are just saying you are not timing the entire body your example code is broken on that bit,0
drop the insinto and replace the doins with dobin build gavd gavd die,0
yes bu using build qemu android sh no android you end up building a pure qemu2 from our qemu android sources i aded the flag to ease the rebase on top of qemu 2 4 2 5 but that is for a diferent patch set and a more complicated one actualy,0
no cros ec should be removed otherwise this is great,0
should not you ad word adr when checking for out of bounds,0
this does suck for smal blueprints lots of sections with the same text in but it does work i gues,1
should be libnfc brcm conf,0
while playing with replacement of bost bind with std bind i am seing the failures to compile on most recent clang that is because std bind canot induce the type of overloaded function 1 so something like that is failing to compile without explicit cast that is going to be ugly b basegfx source range b2drangecliper cx using namespace std placeholders namespace basegfx namespace 496 9 497 9 namespace basegfx b2dpolygon ares std for each mapoints begin mapoints end bost bind std bind b2dpolygon apend bost ref ares std ref ares 1 1 with the folowing eror 2 how can you replce the bind above with labmda 1 2,0

explain that in the case of multiple chrots this daemon proces is kiled by the last exited chrot,0
loks like you screwed up somewhere did you git comit amend when you meant to git comit,1
and this is why this relation is problematic the code here asumes that there is only a single compute nodes record for the service which we know is not an acurate asumption since certain virt drivers can actualy have multiple compute node records for a single host so we actualy ned to remove the compute node atribute of the nova objects service object since we should no longer be using the service object to get compute node information for the absolutely shit brained os hypervisors api extension we wil instead want to make separate cals to a new nova objects computenode get al by host method which wil return al the compute node records for a particular host instead of relying on the above incorect nova objects service compute node atribute,1
should we kil these of now,0
argh i am such an idiot this is of by one so i am runing at 20mhz wil change and retest next time i get my nyan hoked up again,1
delete invalid dcheck,0
const struct bo ops bo ops,0
80 chars limit aplies to the comit mesage also and yes i think that limit is stupid it is our standard however,1
i realy gota flip my default behaviour whenever i se a dodgy loking piece of code i tend to trust it instead of wondering what the fuck it it is trying to do,0
during first run when the sdk folder does not exist yet however in here we care at least as much about remote as local androidsdkdata was just acting as a dumb container for the remote sdk with this being the only client so i just moved it in here so we can do the remote stuf whether or not a local sdk exists,0
nit probably cleaner to return if alocation base is nulptr,0
yeah just kil those lines,0
mauro rodrigues yeah i saw your coment and was puzled so maybe an and i are mising something would you point out exactly where is that tear down method that deletes the resources,0
ya i would kil it,0

what is the purpose of this can you ad a coment,0
grep i want to die thanks for the pointers,0
darn i am blind today actualy it defaults to true in this case if i am not blind again so you can forget about this set of coments sory,1
yeah ugly beast i wil ned to have a closer lok so either you wait for that or back this out and submit separately,1
maybe there should be a coment why do not you use clonedep,0
what about manage py syncdb,0
this br10 should be configurable,0
dex files but why canot you use your comon runtime test h helpers,0
calbacks are isued on the ui thread so you ned to pol it instead of the instrumentation thread alternatively can you use a semaphore instead of poling makes the code easier and gets rid of the ugly poling,0
bad ident should aline with first argument in line above,0
darn i have a red thingy,1
same here and below please remove non javadoc,0
btw here we have only 3 on line slave,0
the rot in this case is not actualy the rot of the dialog just the rot of it is content so a recursive iterative walk up the chain wil go to high this is a prety crapy hack altogether maybe some explanation is in order so dialogwraper sets some basic pading for al dialogs in intelij ux has given us a design doc that asks for slightly diferent padings so i have to walk up the chain and undo the base clas pading in order to set our pading later on,1
imo if we do not return 404 here we ned to return 40 in case of malformed uid,0
eror mesage eror mesage,0
since this is being aded to opt kola you can ad after config external sh below,0
the more you know i am glad that base was not totaly crazy when they did something like this can we curently fed weak ptr to base calback i remember that we used to use the hand roled chrome version of weak ptr in that way,0
can you kil this extra chars line,0
catch your idea remove the posx not defined in glibc,0
should be if bot mode ilo to generic p bot mode lower bot mode,0
darn i wish there was a way to asert something instead of just eroring out on a fail but there is not an asertdoesnotraise lol,1
nit you are inside the dwarf namespace so you do not ned this,0
you have got an evil trailing whitespace here,1
why are we only mocking this for non masters also if we stop mocking out cidb with magicmock and instead use a fake cidb we can probably avoid lots of other mocks of cidb dependent things,0
i fel like we should remove this and triger onregistercompleted instead,0
this is a stupid bug fixed,1
i am confused how are you geting the patch from gerit if you delete the git fetch comand,0
how are you planing to handle heaphashtable heapterminatedaray heaplisthashset,0
let us shot for removing these four lines,0
yeah we could put another atribute on system bin and system xbin and only alow execution of that rather than al system file,0
is not this weird should not they be using include build native test and geting this for fre,0
why do you ned to test a dumy method in adition no asertions,0
user nul should send an eror response instead,0
kil the semicolon,0
maybe we want to be clear about which hypervisors you plan on changing here you are later so it is a micro nit,0
nard pardon the cros build lib conversion obviously failed miserably,0
wait sily gerit hid some lines and it was not obvious i have also refactored this code masively in you might want to wait until that lands,1
these guys sem to make lots of mising parentheses erors trying to be clever,0
delete or are you mising a param,0
damn i kep confusing those,1
this should only be done if an existing cache is not there or if the deployer forces the rebuild of the cache,0
jakub bug in pymod2pkg python subunit should not be transformed into python python subunit for fedora rhel centos,0
can you anotate new load flags has new load flags,0
nit utils mock asert has cals utils cals expected,0
same for this should just be tuskar dbsync,0
you already have the instance so you do not ned the instance uid you do instance instance,0
crap yes,1
i would be a bit amazed if we did not already have a function that does this might want to do some checking around,0
i would even go so far as to disable these warnings they are incredibly noisy and rarely if ever helpful,0
should be mock clients return value get only instances return value severs list,0
this kinda suck as wel is there any kernel standard way of alocating a bufer that is the max of some number of constants aside from kmaloc of course,1
tiny nit a beter condition would be requiredintentfilterpresent perhaps havenableaction should be local to this block and requiredintentfilterpresent would be declared on the third line of this method,0
string serving operator code serving operator getcode,0
what is it a string a number a tuple,0
why do we ned to give such a sily warning instead we should just disable the buton and enable it back when it is ok to click it againor i am mising something,0
remove al ds store in your next comit,0
is the static cast const actualy necesary and is duplication of a one liner realy that bad const cast is realy ugly no mater where you put it i would rather se the logic of geting the vector element duplicated than the const cast,0
r base is a refreg so it sems weird to make this non wide 32b,0
yes limitation of varargs macros there has to be something there the other workaround i have used is log e s no iv provided but i think that is uglier,0
operatortest factorytest,0
useles coments use list h,0
liar,1
ok ode to my own idiocy this is what you said if you want your public functions in the module to work with the same instance of the manager fine you initialize a global object of this type in the module and make those functions to proxy cals to this object making the original singleton object global not making the methods global to the module can you recomend me a bok that explains how to read p,0
i think the right way forward is to make abort 3 actualy you know abort i ve ben meaning to get round to this for a long time and i have finaly started making some progres,0
test atach interface has a mock decorator caling it with like this wil overide the mocked argument cal with key value arguments instead,0
cleanup should only be caled if it actualy worked otherwise you are deleting objects you ned for debuging,0
this is realy ugly the caler should know for certain whether this is the case the caler can simply pas in the corect aray,1
that means doing this given the values of state bak and state sp hdmi mute video anx78x true sp video mute anx78x true useles as they are set to true only in state video outputand then this sp hdcp state hdcp capable check sp tx lt state lt init sp tx vo state vo wait video stable reset audio stable counter sp audio stable count 0 al useles except of course seting tx lt state to lt init which is done below anyway drop these 2 statements,0
you should pas volume obj instead of volume id ovcer rpc methods,0
i think that it is beter to remove description from fields on l587,0
gah they both did that,0
holy crap yeah i distinctly remember me going fixing it removing the entire directory structure and runing cbuildbot to se it recreated i have no idea how this typo poped back and when,1
partial result 0,0
idealy the undef would not be quoted undef is a special pupet value like nil in python,0
shouldresemble loks beter the problem is the stupid value field is a pointer to a string instead of a string and you canot write string value the way you can write compute metadataitems anyways i have moved it to it is own function and therefore it is own tests,1
i think there is a race here with two threads could be executing this statement at teh same time when next method id kmaxmethodid 1,0
i think the sequence above could be formated so if not self is repo initialized elif self is out of date else,0
done these were al mindles translations from the c const char stringfromkeytype,0
do you know why the es402 spec requires that true or yes to be not valid can we change the spec this is a terible hack that just keps growing,0
trm says caution this register is kept for backward software compatibility use gpio irqwaken 0 and gpio irqwaken 1 instead should do rmw on those regs instead,0
bumer except for these lines this cl is entirely deletions you had to ruin it with a modification,0
bad rebase,0
crap that should not be there this was testing some weverything related warning it thinks w and h are not initialized below though al the paths satisfying base and png do initialize them i might do a style pas and change al such c style tests but it is unrelated to actualy fixing trigered warnings,1
thanks i just tested again and it works for me i wil go ahead then,0
there is no way this compiled what is this rubish,1
use er here or if we are going to abort anyway die,0
i swear i have posted a reply twice but maybe gerit is eating it i compiled this on arm and disasembled it and the result used a single 32 bit integer for it,0
yes this is a brain fart,1
kil this coment,0
max response shading max shading ratio shading,0
this is redundant slug is always initialized below,0
i think we ned to do some git cleanup after a failed patch if we are just going to continue runing i e git rebase abort git am abort etc,0
this lineno is not useful it is the lineno of the die func so it wil always be like 69 if you want to make this truly awesome then ad a backtrace func which die wil cal and have your new switch to strict mode cal shopt s extdebug dump trace local j n p skip func src line args a ignore dump trace so start at 2 skip 2 eror backtrace most recent cal is first p 0 for n skip n funcname n do func funcname n 1 src bash source n line bash lineno n 1 args for j 0 j bash argc n 1 j do a bash argv p j args a args done p bash argc n 1 eror printf i file 20s line 4i function s n args s n skip src line func args done,0

i have just realized that this is here this declaration is trash it was moved to the wraper above and i forgot to delete it here it wil be gone in the next patch set,0
nit try to make definition order match the header declaration order or at least do not make it any worse than it already might be,0
m best place would be in ext4 create fs aux info to put this into aux info but then we have to deal with ext4 parse sb info,0
oh shit it is fixed now,1
is not this wasteful couldn t you just dolist componentname componentlist cachedconfigs get s if componentlist nul componentlist new araylist cachedconfigs put s componentlist componentlist ad componentname so you just do one lokup and if neded one insert of the list,0
file name depends on the pid technicaly it is not constant,0
crap this was left over from a diferent version,1
no i am being stupid,0
the goals is to abstract al the members here behave similarly with their private sublists uid statistics begin end for pid as is pid statistics begin end for gone pids if i switch to gonepids even more so with regards to making the code lok simpler and not have to wrap,0
trove build dir and trove integration conf dir ned to be removed here also,0
why are we even doing this header parsing crap btw sems to me this is 1 a time to check time to run race 2 we could just handle the apropriate eror code w in the curl fetch and drop this whole pathway 3 for alternate urls aka xz which we do not actualy suport w in make chrot just lop over the fetch function til one suceds else dumping complaints for al,1

yikes that was dumb of me thanks for catching it,0
hi neutron 3p ci operator here we ned some way to retriger on an ocasional basis and a standard syntax would be nice can we come up with a triger that does not contain recheck at al and just leave that verb to infra to morph as neded retriger redo bastard thirdparty make your shit work now now now unicorns and rainbows does not realy mater what,1
probably beter even though nested structs are a bit ugly in mojo,1
the writer coding conventions say put the on a separate line but i agre with you that that is ugly so do not care that much,0
i don t think you ned these as std strings,0
prevent dirty pages after the zygote forks by caling frezesnapshot,0
in that case my personal take would be the alternative outlined in your first bulet what i leave this up to you,0
if we remove ironic driver from extra specs this should be removed to,0
when you say outside the scope of this clas do you mean that objectpol does not take ownership and that stil means that they should stick around until the objectpol is destroyed in either case clarify the coment,0

did you mean 0x 0 9a fa f again consider 0x da fa f,0
yep fremarker makes this code prety ugly the intent here is that if the string is 50 we insert 50 and if the insert is abc we insert abc in other words the grovy literal is either an int or a string depending on whether the string value in this variable is a string starts with digits or not,0
remove the fake method entirely just do mock get domain return value mock virdomain,0
quick stupid question but why 12,0
you should change the comand line for a test in setupcomandline so this is not neded thanks for sugestion jochen i would love to use setupcomandline but testpaswordgenerationagent is not descendant of inprocesbrowsertest i moved this cal to the test why to ad html atributes in al tests,0
nit unecesary with the coment below above render proces id,0
you should put a konstant in here,0
this does not lok right you should return a cs uno sequence,0
i am somewhat of a fan of stil having the useles 7 4 just to make it obvious that we are seting a field but i gues that is a mater of opinion,0
and you definitely do not ned to parse a string you know this is a sockadr in so just cast,0
so gae suck aps do not have aces to their ap id during init time i had to resort to this late binding via placeholders in the patern strings e g func init validation rules ad services apid config cfg func eror do validation validation rules ad regex projects apid cfg func eror do validation i could not find a cleaner solution the worst part about it is that the actual config loading api cfgclient get does not use apid users wil have to be careful to construct exact same strings as they use in validation paterns do you have any sugestions i m considering moving this placeholders shit up a layer into the rot of the config library so that both cfgclient and validation rules can use it e g we wil be able to do cfgclient get services apid but it ads a weird as concept to already incredibly complicated api,1

if you alowed black list to be nul this would be while ptr ptr,0
nit i think an int32 t is apropriate here and below since size is an int32 t,0

can you stick this in a new local function like asertnotminilayout or whatever name that l make it easier for the tests to stub it al out,0
this wil not force sync flush as i mentioned before i think you can just put a hwid bundle vm sh in srcdir folder,0
sg wil shot to have the folow up cl to implement that out for review this wek thanks,0
you are right i wil remove disk alocation ratio and cpu alocation ratio,0
done did you want me to remove the previously existing aple ifdefs,0

i am fine with arm64 arch64 is ugly anyway,1
you should catch numberformatexception that could be thrownif the value is invalid,0
presumably we could also obtain env sufixes pathsep but it should be the same value this is a prety dumb way to plumb this through but i did not want to make a big change out of this,0
let us rename al activedirectory to dumy or something like this,0
minor we should put the delete before asertequals because if asertequals raise excepiton we wil have no chance to delete this wil because test bed mesy and impact folowing test methods if the cleanes job is important,0
what hapens to the caler in this case the pased in value is fred and not re initialized,0
nit since you are here let us remove these const s and please use stringconstant,0
i gues now that the renderer is mypanel and not simply myparentcombobox it should be mypanel that has ishowing overiden,0
this is c code the proper way would be to use languagetag and this is smely and does fail if the bcp47 tag contains a script code for example i l take over and use a diferent aproach,0
i wonder if there is a cuning hack here for the string h stuf could we take the upstream netbsd versions and ad them to the libc netbsd a but as weak symbols then anyone who has a platform specific optimized version can just ad the file somewhere else and we let the linker favor the strong symbols that might let us avoid a lot of this makefile crap also i wanted to point out that i am not trying to say you must solve my configuration problem for me before i let this change in which is what my previous coment may have sounded like for now fel fre to ignore my coments on the makefile that is just me thinking out loud about where i think we should be going with intel mips and a bunch of diferent arm vendors al wanting their own optimized string h functions i do not think this makefile mes scales it is already unreadable but we do not have to fix everything al at once,1
should this have die,0
would you mind ading chromepreferencemanager resolvechromepreferencemanager to chromeapcomponent and using that getinstance should die eventualy and for that to hapen al retrievals ned to go via dager,0
ach damn there is a rtl ustring release newdata mising right,1
i know this is just a re based change for the r14 branch so ignore the folowing coment if you prefer to kep the patch similar to the one we use for the tot i have changed my mind it makes sense to just make this a static const member local to the sanitize function since that is the only place which uses it you could make this static to this file to but given the large number of these constants i prefer that they were defined in the methods which inturn use them,0
no it asks for new jarfile arfile to be done outside the try block which is sily because it can throw an exception to,0
stupid mistake on my part i asumed since gpio x0 0xa0 gpio x01 0xa1 that gpio x15 0xaf unfortunately gpio x08 gpio x09 are undefined so gpio x15 is actualy 0xad this did not turn up in my testing since my board has ben reworked with a strong pul up on gpio x15 such that it is high by default on bot,0
mouse handler nulptr,0
1 also this file is using fake for these mocks so let us cal this fake also,0
why do you sudenly switch from check dag here unles you require a certain ordering of lines inside the dump file you should always stick with check dag,0
could you change dump value as text and compare to string by expect streq to make what this test does and se where do we fail by string dif this is yet another code and we do not want to debug test code,0
let us make the typenamespace and iodelegate into protected members and save ourselves this indirection,0
i think a god rule of thumb if you are using mock x then it is a mock if you do not use anything it is a fake this loks like a fake to me,0
i hate to be that guy but this should probably be a diferent change,0
that one should go away it is a default and it wil be kiled today,0
so newest synced revision is realy a comit position,0
i think you can update by uid by joining them and using uid but i gues one could argue against deviating to much from what we have in place now and optimize later just sems kinda ugly,1
if you get here then atmpstate astate so this asignment is not useful,0
self filter cb filter cb,0

i aded this originaly to mark what serverwindows had cfs asociated with them it would be similar if you did if has created compositor frame sink otherwise you can just merge this into the stringprintf,0
oh i am dumb,0
edit also i am an idiot and it should of course be 4 bytes per pixel in the framebufer for rgb8 so same question but make the math 136 4 5464 and align up 136 4 16 5472,0
so useles,0
oh this is ugly please change the format of extra rpm repos to name url priority so get repo url and get repo priority boil down to get repo url shel echo 1 cut d f2 get repo priority shel val echo 1 cut d f3 echo val 10,1
ah crap how embarasing abandoning,1
darn thanks for trying maybe someday in the future did u open a isue with the author i m sure he she would like to know,1
i wish we could move away from using strings to expres mocks we could use actual imports and it would be a lot more efective no action required on your part though,0
why is nulable true neded in the model nulable is not specified and i think the default value of nulable is false,0
this should be adsufix toc built shared libraries anyway i think two adsufix would be beter than adsufix and filter out,0
stupid question as a temporary solution can we only return a version if it loks like x y z,0
extra empty line or a spare one after the folowing section coment,0
bol skip first stack check false skip first stack check for readability another posibility would be to introduce flags with kskipfirststackcheck and kanalyzenvironmentlivenes,0
this returns a buferedimage if we store it as buferedimage we can remove the ugly nuls from the getwidth and getheight cals,1
this should be part of stack sh where everything else gets instaled i am for maintaining the status quo of run tests sh not instaling anything,0
this should be colapsed down to log warning lw,0
are waiting for response and is load to diferent document used somewhere else if not they should be removed,0
can kil this if we kil the delayed shutdown se coment in c file,0
in curent ps db max atempts is useles,0

i forgot how this lok in text proto it may lok ugly,0
wtf uses what the fuck make noncopyable,1
ack i wil remove them al,0
nit best not to indent these bulets and best to have spaces betwen each bulet,0
i fel dumb done,0
is not it beter long term to implement the proc pid solution now,0
even though i hate friending maybe make clas a friend so you can make this non public and les eror prone,0
remove al printf,0
ned to initialize put ofset here or maybe as an initializer in flushparams,0
remove android,0
i thought selinux had kiled botchart should we just remove it,0
why not chromite lib paralel backgroundtaskruner with backgroundtaskruner simulate slave as queue for slave in m iter queue put slave,0
and the naive me thought that there should not be an isue like this if i copy n paste these headers from other files wil be corected in the next version of the patch set,0
these warnings are totaly useles and are not doing what the author thought they would sigh,0
why do not you initialize weak ptr factory as weak ptr factory this in the header file and remove this duplication from both constructors,0
dislike this here is there a beter place for this constant alternatively leave it here then we move the git crap out of this lib into it is own module,1
dumb linters,0
i know you are just modifying this but what the heck is the point of this block,1
sdkconstants value true,0
garbage urls wil crash this we should wrap this in a try catch for urisyntaxexception,0
is the plan to nuke al losetups or just as many as posible,1
oh that suck let me se if i can figure out something that does not involve a ton of rules based on mac adreses,1
we can insert one build mesage for each canceled slave build id master build id mesage type abort slave mesage subtype self destruction mesage value slave build id this works for you,0
should this be enforced in the method cals themselves by checking eror that would be prety invasive and nasty and may not be any beter,0
nit entsize 0,0
nit might be marginaly more performant to do my pids extend get my pids if pid in my pids,0
change faking conectioneror to faking keystoneclient raising conectioneror keystoneclient has always raised conectionrefused as far as i know so it is not acurate to say that this is something that changed,0
crap yes of course since the lop is gone sigh,1
i expect that we should deprecate this for one cycle so the removal should hapen in ocata,0
my fault i mised this one from previous review we should return empty list migrations when there is not any runing migration and did i mis something we said on irc we return al type migration in this api the last sentence say we only return live migration at here,0
i think that delete orphan wil be useles since the fk canot be made nul anyways so there is not a case where secret user metadata instance can be an orphan,0
optional use this signedin instead since that is the actual property trigering this change handler,0
nit i think this wants to return step odict returning an empty dict makes this inherently behave like dropexpectation,0
i gues the function name createopacityelement would be self evident enough to indicate the field as the opacity value ading opacity 1 f may not give more useful information,0
i think we should kil this logic fwiw fine to be identical for now but ad a todo for that,0
bol jump detected,0
very nit picky on my part but i find negative ints in config files to be most ugly any reason this canot be 0 i understand this is a chery pick but honestly i think it is worth considering to change it in master as wel,1
dito but particularly in this case a user id may not be a uid if it is coming from ldap or some other backend,0
let us mention here the original test case not qa elf sh,0
future language designers take note this is the kind of silines that results when you do not alow trailing comas,0
typo and double negative also please do not break strings over several lines especialy not with backslash continuation the prevailing wisdom even in the linux kernel is now that going over 80 characters is the leser evil compared to breaking a string that someone might grep for,0
yes that is the best choice for upstream ndk use you may or may not want to define file ofset bits 64 for your own builds this only made it to the ndk around l irc so it is probably not an option for upstream the other alternative popular on android is to just always use the 64 variants that works great unles you ned to build on mac os to they do not have any of this stupid compatibility cruft which makes it especialy sad that android shiped with a 32 bit of t,0
this is an eror prone aproach that is al but guaranted to bite you on the but when you are not loking what you want to do is filter for alowed characters rather than filtering out disalowed characters that is obviously harder to do but you could do something like alowed chars re compile r s w if not alowed chars match string to check raise exception,1
the m trafo member should be unused now so it can be removed,0
network id empty,0
damn god catch i have got to ad them in setup cfg,1
ah that makes sense incomplete clas limits us a lot shrug nit otherwise maybe a global template clas datatype using internalnodeatachedatastoragefor internalnodeatachedatastorage sizeof datatype could help,0
per tom this sounds like it should be an h3 i am not sure if the h3s that folow should in turn be h4s,0
please remove halign start to align the control left and right,0
sily coment but first line and only one line neds to be a sumary,0
it fels weird that when you stop the handler al pending requests get reset but then you can queue up requests while the handler is stoped and they wil get procesed when the handler starts should we disalow requests in a stoped handler then the reversenumeration test can go away,0
this about a eoghan glyn question here personaly i m not sure that gnochi should handle this case,0
i thought about it but i hate makefiles and their weird language so i thought extracting the list of files was god enough,0
ned help untwisting your panties there zer0 one,1
you do not ned subst here it is beter to write it as ifneq use dex2oat debug false dex2oat dex2oatd endifdex2oat dependency dex2oat,0
it is a waste of space and brain drain to use useles wrapers and yes windows is stupid for not being posix compliant,1
afaik we do not implement per rule subscriptions for now so those can be kiled,0
oh man super anoying,1
i gues i can retype them if another problem ocurs i wil remove them,0
smart as nit of the day that patch did not introduce a regresion as the option did not exist before it simply introduced an option that does not actualy work,1
this maping wil leak if any of the aserts get hit before you munmap it we should put these through a scopedmap same in the next function,0
we stil have sramfunc in plat pmu macros s so we ned sram test and sram data oh it so stupid use wrong sram sizebefore,1
kbits kbitsperbyte sizeof t,0
these min max are not neded for this controler i just delete them then,0
sudo logic for this is actualy prety stupid it considers the first argument that lacks a in it as the executable target so it is not hard to hack that one up,1
pavel mentioned an alternate way to do this that makes registeroptionshandler obsolete here se,0
i do not think you can use procesmanager here you can only stop proceses that are started created by procesmanager i think you can just use kil instead,0
sory this is yuck even if the debuger is not atached you ned to make this cal and go into the compiler to figure it out not super hapy about that design,1
ok i understand this change it loks like tegra cortex a9 does not realy have a size of 6 but that the 6 is not harmful on tegra and is now the default for v7 sounds ok,0
u bot is hardcoded to expect uenv txt a directory level above bot scr uimg,0
al of these options are prety bad maybe least bad while not breaking the build would be to ad something to request i would actualy stick with a dumb bolean or something instead of yet another interface having retrypolicy and newretrypolicy wil be even more confusing if it is unclear that they are both actualy used something like request setshouldretryservererors bolean,0
is it ok to have dead pbr,0
you are not inherting any eclas that would set up things and you are not seting src uri so this dumy func is not neded just delete it,0
it is ugly it could be as wel value os environ get name return bolean states get value lower default but imho stil it is uglier than what is here,1
drop the die here and below,0
gruby apears to be included with fedora but not ubuntu or coreos,1
i am just being lazy i wil change it to suport both,0
neds die,0
serial data type t is an enum should not it be returned by value,0
the purpose of overiding is to not create the port when deploying with an external balancer,0
ops i completely mised that the uma is only about username despite it having username in it is name that was stupid of me fixed now,0
cephx should be configurable,0
god catch it suck that we have multiple name spaces for the same stuf,1
you already git depend on that so this should not be necesary,0
do not you want these two in reverse order also the store should be a release store if you want to guarante that samples map is only sen fuly initialized but maybe this oesn t realy mater because this hapens way earlier,0
same just put these directly into tspi test libs below,0
i think you should also ad a bulet that says improve test coverage,0
make this a phony target or else we wil not rebuild the init when template arguments change phony local built module,0
we have sen cases where text fields are hiden and then visible when you try to edit them webdriver throws and eror that the web element is not in an editable state this has made this generic more robust except for now there are some text boxes that aparently do not suport geting the value atribute even if they are not pasword text fields ridiculous,1
this and the line below have very ugly wrapings you are changing a single string that spans multiple lines so it is ok to re wrap the afected lines,1
event log should be eliminated by testlog so let us do the migration now,0
you should absolutely remove the period here plog ads a colon and an eror string,0
same dumb question,0
we have rhel computes i gues we ned rpm package to,0
this is clearly stupid and wrong,1
i wil kil this extra blank line on next refresh,0
i think you should only ad pins wp remove others under mc1 pins default,0
i agre block the knuckleheads,0
use a unique ptr you can std move them into bindonce and this is definitely much more preferable compared to a raw new and base owned in general there is no reason to ever use base owned for anything other than the this argument of a bind,0
should be asert true since you dereference it later on,0
i am curious how slow is this i have writen a c replacement qmerge that unmerges packages realy realy fast,0
json does not alow trailing comas because it is dumb also a bunch of lines below,1
why is this a unique ptr this is data owned by the oat file potentialy and canot be deleted,0
beter just remove this completely than introduce a roting debug cpu uno,0
flag track double fields flag unbox double fields,0
please do not have using statements importing names in a header please fuly qualify them in the c file fel fre to do whatever aids convenience,0
crap these are not static because of the ut right,1
is a thinko worst than a mere typo like someone actualy thought about it first,0
i think you should mention about your pupet glance change in comit mesage,0
this creates d out opt i do not think that is what you want,0
kindly purge the asociated events as wel while purging the resources,0
ah i spel it like that because of substitution ignoring failed iptables n discovery blah blah so it loks like a comand,0
endif libqmi qmidev mock h,0
that sems sqlite specific considering that you have isues with further migrations after this one sucesfuly pases i fel that this patch is just useles,0
maybe ul or some more explicit 64bit type arm9 32bits to smal,0
if you lok at the original cl that introduced the sh host metric they want to track down dead hosts to kil it makes sense to leave around the sh host creation metric using a dumy host so they know this atenuator host exists,0
they are actualy there already so i removed these redundant dchecks also removed the redundant coments,0
bol built fixed codes false here no ned to set it in constructor i think you could also do the same for al the vector resizes,0
i think we can actualy drop al these discoverable policies,0
you want the oposite right self minimum duts 0,0
ya thats ugly,1
this might make some aditional things dirty since if only the virtuals were dirty and the directs were not now al methods would be marked dirty,0
it is super ugly i put an example in buart unitests which i suply for unit testing i l put a short version that only has what i am loking for here,1
yes we should be able to use the simd instructions vcnt on arm and cnt on arm64,0
kil 0 basicaly validates the pid that is a smart way to validate a pid i wil update makefile with kil in a separate cl there is another case here though where the master could be dead but the pid is valid and does not belong to the master maybe check the comand line as wel or cwd of the pid fds etc i believe that it should be considered as unhealthy status of twistd for example if make status returns 0 for a proces runing but unhealthy then pupet or most of system management tol would believe that it is not runing and the folowing etc init d buildbot start would fail at the folowing check we could also update the above python check function but i believe that the example case you provided should be handled by a separate proces checking for the health of a service the pid is valid and does not belong to the master in other words etc init d status should return runing if a proces is runing for the service either it is healthy or not if make status should not be limited to the usage of etc init d buildbot then i would sugest to have another make target for health checking however once buildbot is migrated to service manager this makefile wil no longer be used,0
nit nulptr out static user agent setings,0
might want to use reverse true here if the highest priority step neds to be executed first,0
note that the non hover behavior is about to change,0
or ret cyapa read byte if ret 0 dev er goto out cyapa m bl ret,0
format string default format string,0
realy we have to uter host twice in this construct so redundantlyrepetitive,0
this coment is incorect it is the interface id do you realy ned to store this id can we just remove this member,0
you stil have the framelistener and al these caching things they should be removed and only a set of static methods should remain,0
so al that we wil actualy ned to do is ad the securecontext anotation on securecontext interface worklet namespace cs securecontext atribute worklet paintworklet,0
interesting that you can pas nulable as a positional param here but the way you have done a number of the subclases it can only be pased as a kwarg param sugestes doing def init self kwargs self nulable kwargs pop nulable false here even though i hate that,0
i kept this nul abstime check because previous calers were protected from nul timespec and i do not want to introduce new bugs i separated pthread cond wait since the logic to deal with nul or not timespec s was ugly,0
s int size t or if you want to be anal vector string size type,1
m5sum note curently does not work for large objects,0
i wil export this as adb dirname,0
but we would be copying with the same register as source and destination in that case would not we,0
wtf is this lol,1
why not use a unique ptr this way you do not ned to fre it explicitely in onshutdown,0
this this is prety simple you can use a dict comprehension for this return dict k v for k v in if isinstance v criticaleror but do you ever expect the value not to be a criticaleror,0
if there is a set of member vars that is controled by a mutex member var i would place them into a block of their own with the mutex member var at the head of the block as a means of documentation,0
you should be using string rather than std string throughout,0
crap ned to update this words to match the deployment guide,1
can we do beter than puling al the records and doing the sum in python at large volume counts this is going to suck i suspect try it with 1 milion volumes sql count and sum would be beter i would expect,1
nit i would cal this agent az,0
done i l discus with joel and find a way to check the pid in pidfile is instalog or not,0
replaced this function with key operator does not help for what the fuck hashmap,0
it hints to the compiler to generate les shit code which somehow apears necesary perhaps we should upgrade the compiler,1
this cal to str here is useles,0
wtf capdata cap to index n permited,0
hiding crap thanks,1
nit please move inside trans,0
i do apologize for this i am a mes and i should be hanged upside down,0
wow did we mis an obvious bug right here what idiot lgtm d this i m fixing this as part of another cl now,1
blank line should be removed,0
very tiny nit there are two spaces before if,0
ah damn it forgot to amend thanks,1
if you have more than one mising parameter this mesage is going to lok ugly a not suplied to vboxdriver b not suplied to vboxdriver,1
hm what about the protected buf that is basicaly api and i am not sure what if anything people asume about it is contents thanks sun you retard s,0
oh god damn it,1
ok so my coment above is not a real problem hostles job timeout wil set aborted bit of al child jobs and shard client should sync the abort bit to shard db and abort al child jobs this cl should prevent master scheduler to set the is complete bit of child jobs runing in shard as their aborted bit is set to true,0
how about this ugly construct while value check for power on event,0
are al of these values only for vmware or is one relevant for other hypervisors,0
six should be grouped with clif as they are both 3rd party,0
please change al stubing out of new to stuboutclaswithmocks as explained above,0
nit this could just be drawable drawable thumbnailgradient,0
this is kinda crapy but i ned a cleaner test suite due to how gradle does it is reporting hapy to discus this change,1
i dislike al of this webapk specialisation as much as you and i want to get rid of as much as if as posible,0
coment style multi line coments like this should go before the line in question,0
yeah mx cprng draw max len is just define x 256 not 256u stupid language maybe the cast there is beter anyway fixed read len location,1
could not figure out a great way of doing this,0
nit put members below methods,0
kil these to,0
i do not even know why idea inserted this here kiling,0
wrong param should be cg ref,0
hrm it sems like this method s name is ful of lies if it is result neds to be anded with 07,0
no eror checking just because the existing code is crap does not mean new contributions are alowed to forego standard practices,1
list is internal identifier and xlist is a stupid name,1
you are suposed to use list for each safe rather than list for each when using list del are not you,0
hm yes try should be removed,0
danalbert made this unecesary we have even started to remove them in places,0
should this clas be a traybackgroundview subclas,0
is this just some nasty side efect tastic constructor or is this actualy unused,0
ah how about using const bol region dump argc 9 if region dump else area size scren size,0
actualy let us just kep this no ned to kil it of realy,0
the jit may violate this anyways e g single invocations of run tests wil not be compiled so al the is compiled aserts would fail for this to realy be tested for jit we would have to change the test setup in a lot of tests,0
i think you should put this down to the non verified bot alongside the run net bot and run usb bot,0
yeah it is like this code has entered a squishing competition sucky if you ask me but agre with the line removal here and below it is consistent with the rest of the code and that maters more than anything else when coding at chrome team scale,1
remove libc,0
this wil be an eror prone build failure should be supreswarnings deprecation lol,0
i destroy dev priv wq on failure,0
i do not se how is that diferent from myrendersesion nul nul myrendersesion getresult,0
and more constructively to avoid that you wil want to also check syncservice isyncfeaturenabled,0
given the test failures loks like you ned to remove yourself as an observer in your destructor,0
the pid would be useful here so that in case multiple migrations hapen in the same time you could distinguish betwen them,0
no the v60 arays do not provide any eficient way to directly copy snapshot data into a new lun which is why it is being done on the client side even though it suck i wil make a note to lok into this again but i am prety sure at this point there is nothing i can do,1
changed to what the fuck hashmap,1
please put this in an own makefile maybe package emoji mk you might ned to register it somewhere else grep for package clasification,0
so for nova baremetal and ironic config drive does not work does devstack cater for that or should we duplicate the logic perhaps in wrap sh,0
this again is mixing uint and int i think we should fal on the side of uint because level is not something that can be negative but maybe i am just a performance hating pedant anyone else have an opinion on int vs uint,0
code is cleaner without i variable i think how about for af gpio alt funcs af gpio alt funcs gpio alt funcs count af,0
this check is pointles the code above would not have compiled if this was false,0
this violates git comit mesage style leave a blank line betwen the sumary and the description could you also paste the caliper output as is in the comit mesage it is generaly ok for the comit description to be verbose as long as the sumary is clear,0
we are talking about a u8 so i would write this simply as 0,0
heh because dash suck and alows you to do this kind of crap yes this should be fixed,1
this requires disabling webm io explicitly could make it only disable webm io with a warning but i think this is best,0
actualy it is not so it is should be ran for each device the reason why it is work now dirty hack with disabling udev rules for usual disks so i would like to do not remove this triger,0
urlencode again would be nice instead of doing the string munging yourself,0
i gues users is a generic group so it is okay to asign gofy to this group,0
i think we would want lstat is mtd on a symlink should fail,0
why not ceph mon hostname,0
realy those people who send cls without compiling localy the worse,0
gah this is horible however in this case it is ok because we never use this to do sync compute nodes meaning it never goes over rpc,1
same even more this code is a dublicate,0
nit this wil actualy print hresult hresult 0xf remove the hresult,0
ad a dcheck that byte count strlen,0
s nonsenses nonsense and yes i completely agre they are nonsense,1
this is redundant with miror throwable dump actualy i would change the whole mesage to os pending exception exception dump,0
yeah sory folks was asked for a quick upload threw it together and pushed it up think it is very obvious i did not test the damn thing sorting it and pushing it post testing canot verify it fixes it can t induce the timeout on my own hardware but it wil be devoid of these idiot mistakes patch to come shortly,1
unles the atomics grown on me overnight i think i wil remove them in the morning a thread should only lok at it is own pid so this just fels like we are implying there is something subtle going on when there is actualy no reason for this,0
also i m stupid but how does this kick of the tests and not wait for them what is it overiding in hwteststage that makes it fire and forget,0
ah crap sory,1
if making cmd record cp use eventselectionset we can hide eventselection entirely,0
config ftrace is expensive and not necesary for systrace al you ned is config sched tracer,0

this is kind of ugly you can define a simple helper,1
use cros build lib die instead,0
i think link value could be uninitialized here to resulting in a garbage print,0
a x also i think you wil ned to set the user bit setuid to be able to send signals to pid 1 setuid sbin shutdown unles you wil be caling this as rot,0
yes it should be what the fuck was i thinking,1
i think you can just ad these to the end of the enum below instead of using define gpio part2 starts gpio e0,0
i would prefer that the implementation of dvmcompilercacheflush was a nop than ifdef ing around the calers,0

just abort with a mesage most android stuf including tests themselves just is not going to work wel without android data,0
in my mind this is to prevent the user for ading some stupid like keystone config identity domain specific drivers enabled value blah or keystone config identity domain config dir value somewhere else it is just a pedantic check but may be useful,0
no action required yuck references to global config in a method that could acept the values instead curse you mixins,1
that seriously ned a javadoc coment here what the heck does fidelity mean in a log context maybe a more explicit name would be beter,0
sigh yeah i can se why you had to do this stupid compiler stil can you please hide this with the ofsetof calculation inside the mux and pl macros instead of puting another register list here,1
no this os is temporary alocated on stack and wil be destroyed at the end of this function,0
can we promote this declaration up a level now it sems sily to have this as a block local variable inside of each case,0
ad get info remove setup edge,0
i se i did not realize layout was actualy checking location bar with the stated purpose per coment of waiting until post init that does make it more apealing than i would thought to use that it also avoids any posibility of a startup perf regresion due to doing unecesary layout here what if we just changed that initial layout conditional to check something slightly diferent the most obvious would be a new bolean member initialized les obvious would be some kind of condition that is only true after the home buton is initialized or the like the later is kinda fragile against future reorderings though so i do not mind the explicit member,0

i might be misunderstanding but this is just a clamp and not an afine transformation originaly i had code like this but i was told by clint that this was undesirable as once uesrspace starts requesting values lower than low threshold the backlight never changes in other words you have to dim 3 times after you hit the low threshold before you get to black what vijay recomended in the email earlier in the day does exactly this as i said there i think my solution is beter whatever you guys want is fine with me though,0

thanks so that is what the dumy directory is for i aded a dumy versions of the code so the tests compile with fed disabled but then hit a crash while trying to run the ntp tests stil crashed after compiling on master so filed crbug 897502 i think we should have something like fednewtabpage isfedsuported if not skip the test iteration with fed enabled to fix crbug 897502 in a separate cl wdyt,0

it was for some stupid wsgi stuf but it might have ben a red hering il remove and rerun tox,0
there is a spurious i at the end actualy you can just nest the if inside the cflags,0
i se that is the eror because you are trying to overwrite existing dir with symlink while rsync a was to fix symlink overwriting broken symlink probably beter to write a python script to do the copy so you can select whatever to copy,0
actualy this sems to make sense as there is obviously no proces kiling but directory deleting,0

there is no hwmod entry for opt clocks this is extract from clocks other than fck ick ned to make use of clock fw apis if required for fck ick do not use clock fw apis as omap device layer apis takes care of the same there is a opt clk fld for other clocks example gpio has debounce clock there is a opt clk field en the hwmod structures but they are not enable when you enable the device static int enable clocks struct omap hwmod oh the opt clocks are controled by the device driver return 0 so loks like opt clocks has to be controled by the device driver therefore it is a software isue the module should not dependeds of what are you runing on the remote procesor can you please rephrase i am not sure i am folowing just teling we should not base a9 module on what a remote procesor is runing it should be generic so the restriction from having one or multiple user should come from a9 side of curse if ducati side can manage only one user it can put a restriction on the rm runing on ducati however i think having only one user for al the resources is the safer way,0
if streaming wil be handled in nova could you wrap the operation using zlib perhaps to compres the data sory if this is a stupid question,0

i would like to not ad non trivial functions to real system state systemstate is an ugly agregator of the singletons we have in the update engine to easily alow us to mock out the rest of the system ading this here means you canot unitest it you could unitest this as we do in the conection manager c how about moving this to either it is own clas or the updateatempter,1
crap i wrote this code this is very sad,1

it would be nicer to use size t old fingerprint end old sdp strspn r n but it sems that what the fuck string does not have a strspn equivalent this wil work,0
why did you go for the pthread implementation over the spinlock implementation should we kil the spinlock implementation move the pthread implementation into the ned quasiatomic block at the botom and have non lrdex arm and mips and x86 al fal through to that my primary concern here is that i do not want two copies of this code in the same file but if i can kil the spinlock stuf at the same time that is even beter actualy i wil do this for you,0
so what is the recomendation here stil return false and just kil the eror msg,0

my first reaction is yuck that is unreadable i do not think it is necesary in this case since this is only used in one function one file and not likely to have it is use extended i agre that in multiple functions a custom comparator would be highly desirable to prevent mis use but i tried it and i gues it is not so bad so for the sake of god practice even if not necesary i could change it,1

i am not sure what you mean by this coment al other designated initializers including init are ns unavailable it does not ever make sense for the animator to be created without a start progres in practice this is just created with a start progres of 0 as an arbitrary value as the actual animator is not used in this test except for through an equality test below i have aded a coment stating that this is a dumy value,0
these probably belong in a header somewhere like other method function declarations,0
again it sounds like what the fuck size t is expected here since these are what the fuck vector,0
why you changed this to ecx it is garbage here,1
if the read operation fails how to guarante that the value in val is corect and that you are not writing garbage back,0
you wil ned to deal with multiple headers at some point e g we ned sane behavior when a sily server sends sec origin policy 0 nsec origin policy policy,0
dito above it probably makes sense to abort here,0
why not provide an acesor to an interator you are building a vector only to throw it away,0
so now al of this code is useles if the cal to gat config c complete is not neded delete the rest of the code as wel please,0
ned to preserve pading and style border right 2px solid white here,0
this means 2 wil be regenerated whenever you run make,0
not neded afaict multiple is set on push back so multiple pids isempty,0
this is very wrong you should not cal your mocks you can do what you meant here like this patch file mock open return value and then you do not ned to store this in a separate variable do you,0
again not sure about none as a falback also nonetype has no atribute split,0

np at al yes let us remove them,0
also ned sigkil to al domains for kil pid sigkil,0
nit die,0
i wonder if we want nova to have a whitelist of alowed plug in scripts to limit the impact of a compromised neutron system although the more i think about that the more stupid that sounds,0
this should get removed it is ok for libclcore to have more functions than is necesary and we must always build it with the latest api level rs version,0
this was nasty loging log aded extra cals to time time which made this test depend on the psutil version instaled,1
roger i was being very dumb i went and talked with bsimonet and then ate al my words back burp,0
hah damn it i meant and i am not intending to be contrary sory the brain s not fuly there right now,1

we probably want to use kargs in future,0
yes they are it is actualy a way to shot yourself in the fot seting framerate to 240 101 wil be diferent from 240 101 we canot do much about this,0
testcapi is junk i think that at least on my linux builder it does not actualy build which is why i exclude it,1
should be if not sample filter start timestamp or not sample filter end timestamp,0
ah crap this is non trivial to implement eficiently given the curent entity structure i wil implement it half asedly and warn in the doc about that,1
yes i should remove this useles change,0
typo firstrigthparenthesisindex should be firstrightparenthesisindex,0
the default for gtest is 4ulp the main reason for this change is to move to tighter bounds this explicitly asuming i have not fucked up the code in math data test h aserts 1ulp interestingly glibc can manage 0ulp on several of these tests but we can t,1
i think it should be squashed in previous requst,0
for group flags no it would beter not to be nul in case it is we want a bang here,0
od and undone to damn many patchsets,1
ok if the spec says the type can be nul the dcheck must be removed,0
let us default this suck we already implicitly cache other stuf i canot imagine the number of instances on a single host being that large although someone can corect me,1
after cleanup parent with no child then only secret2 should be removed since secret1 does have a child,0
damn it is to early in the morning i did not even lok to the left and se the is not set sigh so i think in this case the hda reconfig is actualy being selected by some other config and that is how it is becoming set let me track down exactly what did it,1
cmp op1 reg 0 and get rid of op2 reg,0

nit i do not supose these delays have a name in dsi parlance that we could ad as a coment like t3 50ms,0
our style guide not withstanding stop vs stop sems like a recipe to get bit in the as i have use a lowercase stop here instead of the usual capitalization,1
it was proposed to replace complete sentense part this fix is is useles,0
yeah the ones above are realy bad your system is corupt and i am going to tel you about it this one hapens normaly the caler wil output an eror if al it is cals to this function fail but if you are debuging this was useful once maybe i should just remove it instead,0
thanks i did not even know about that interface done,0
the dbusproperties proxy is created by and used by the modem object and that clas has it is own set of unit tests to confirm the proxy is created and used corectly modemanager s unit tests ned to confirm only that the modem init is caled it does that by making sure the task factory is not empty after the cal we could go a step further and run the event lop but sems redundant idealy we would pek into the factory or the even lop and confirm that the pending task is initask,0
align8 to align128 are unused remove them,0
parking this slave here wil use it son to retire the vm of the mips builder below,0
this wil also kil proceses that did not respond to sigterm above,0
do not we want to dump the log after we kil the devserver just in case it printed something useful before it died,0
whoever created secureblob outdid themselves this should have ben just certificate data instead of this very weird and dangerous contraption since front might return a value and not a reference to the first element,1
argh i gues indent region wil not get this and fix the u bot formating damit as for u32 vs unsigned int i use u32 when it is clearly fixed as to bit width and matches a register directly but unsigned ints make sense when it is just a value that wil get jamed into some bit field i do not like using fixed width elements unles it sems mandatory and directly matches some register i am doing some interpolation here from the u bot stuf and they were not very careful however i would like to leave this alone for now example the win id is 2 bits there is no god way to expres that bit fields are a botch signed the guy who invented them so i think unsigned int is reasonable,1
actualy nothing presentationdispatcher is suposed to do the right thing by caling setcontroler imediately after conecting to presentationservice but anything could hapen for a misbehaving renderer,0
nope just a boneheaded mistake just like mising the sendto right above it,1
please use target out intermediates and target 2nd arch var prefix target out intermediates to take care of both obj and obj arm in case of multilib bulid,0
what the heck does that mean,1
if you are going to put author and date why not use the javadocs i think the styleguide says you can leave them out if you want,0

i should remove myfidelitywarnings from this line,0
make sure this module is invoked as the main program if name main parse edid,0
the next cl is uploaded already and untangling two of these is probably not worth the time it takes in git if you prefer i can squash both of these cls together,0
this wil be 0 so this is a useles printout,0
yeah it is kinda crapy though i would rather not split this line,1
please do not use cfgclient i would like to kil it please use lower level,0
sems cleanup network group method should be removed,0
compile the bot image with and without and dump the init failures dump init failures x log compare and if necesary open a bug do not leave a todo here,0
corect the consent is for make model information about a token not for individualy identifiable information the only way to get the underlying atestation wil be to list the rp id in the enterprise policy because that enables the individual atestation bit in the register request and permits individual atestation generaly,0
it is beter to check the existence of tolchain src dir first,0
no damnit okay so we are realy close now the only thing i do not like is that we have both rk clrsetbits and rk setmsk which do the same thing we should have only one of the two please just 1 remove rk clrsetbits and change everything that uses it to rk setmsk 2 change to define rk setbits val rk setmsk val val 3 change to define rk clrbits val rk setmsk 0 val then we wil be fine alternatively you could remove rk setmsk and replace it with rk clrsetbits one or the other i am fine with either just not both at the same time,1
i think you ned hit test region state input region,0
i gues this is suposed to list the original comits that are being squashed here but it does not sem to be a valid git comand,0
is this 0 a mistake or am i to stupid to understand some clever trick here sems to me you meant if retry is none or atempt retry if so sounds like tests ned improvement,0

beter to remove previous status with empty suportstatus object,0
tar mock self patchobject etc etc,0
this is something to do with detecting when kati neds to regenerate teling it to ignore dirty files anywhere under out dir it should not be afected by this patch these are output files from kati not input files so it wil not check if they are dirty,0

the lack of a white space here byte is the only thing about this change that anoys me i wil try to tweak the style rules to fix this if i do not suced i wil submit it anyway btw are you sure no one s submiting code to this project in branches that automerge into master there l be hel to pay for in merge conflicts if that is the case,1
dead cpde,0
damn you copy paste changed thanks,1
interesting this loks like a dirty hack is there a way to fix this in a more proper way,1

i do not know it is probably ok the way it is as these execute during initialization and curently we log an eror mesage clean up and exit the daemon when we hit these erors which is fine by me unles you fel strongly about this i wil not change it,0
wtoken startingdata nul,0
we should cache this somewhere otherwise it gets converted from std string on each cal,0
i am not sure if writing to the paded area is important for this test the name and coments sort of imply it is but you could use info getsafesize krowbytes here minimize the change no,0
again this library stuf is not bad but is not great i want crinkle to get input i am okay with it but i would prefer not to extend the beaker beaker rspec dsl with our own crap,1

jvm details ignoramus here is it a comonly known thing that values of an enum is equivalent to it is values method,0
you removed the important warning that this is a hack and not a proper solution,0
leaving alone for now since it does not make much sense to propagate such a tristate up to the superclas,0

scopedutfchars wil already have thrown an apropriate exception so you should probably just remove l454 45,0
having code after asert false is nonsensical as it aparently must be dead code this is presumably just worth a sal info or a sal warn to kep consistent with the rest of the code se above,0
ec timeout usec old timeout,0
should we stil log a meaningful mesage if the cluster was not found instead of having an atributeror,0
i thought there was already a patch with a get document from search but i canot find it in any case i would be fine with generalising this and moving it into helpers although i would prefer to file a bp with neutron to ask that the sec group id be included in rule delete notifications because that would be infinitely preferable,0
this loks like a very ugly hack which is also very fragile are there absolutely no other way to do this check,0
config nic3com should be config nic3com,0

when dealing with libnl event subscriptions went to the bit bucket when wifi was down things may have changed since i dumped it but i am asuming that the limitation was in the driver kind of stupid of libnl if it is not from ofline discusions i have moved the subscription to wifi c and removed wifistate,0
make this static i am guesing you did not kil the prev next fields of fdevent because fdevent h is also used by sysdeps win32 cp which stil uses the fields,0
there is no bitcode generation at al unles the dumy function is present,0
should not this be ldr w1 sp to avoid loading the 4 bytes above and corupting the method parameter,0
instead of the export can we just do a return also probably be god citizen and set apache version to local so we do not polute the namespace,0
it have sense but in this case we move knowledge about primary prefix outside of objects package as for me it is bad we work with stupid objects and track al keys in al intermediate dicts is very dificult especialy if they change to such objects smudged acros al code,0
i mean 4 bilion domed files with the same hash is ridiculous but if we are seriously woried about it we could use an int64 instead and not wory about overflow that would use les memory and be faster than a guid,0
cel atributes toltip dict get would be suficient you do not ned the get help text function,0
iuc you are deliberately storing a raw zx handle t rather than e g a zx unowned log or unowned handle because that makes it more obvious that this handle is no longer valid once we have returned it from pashandles,0
ps i have used these kinds of sleps when there is nothing to check but they are painful and should be way longer than your testing shows is neded in case of heavy system load in particular on a vm on a builder the load is stupid high and kernel background threads may not run for 30 minutes or more,1
blocked without snifing maybe maybe reorder,0
i inlined checkdecodeacelused and checkdecodeaceleror,0
wtf is the reason for that prexisting nonsense,1
yuck,1
please ignore this coment i am stopid,0
even though i am a moron and forgot that the main purpose of this is to handle private key los i think it actualy stil makes sense to run the mitigator in the case of public key los as wel the code is already set up to deal with re writing the policy blob and the public half of the key pair is pushed to disk and everything we can just have the other code that would start new key generation to not run in the case that mitigation is hapening which is easy to detect given a pointer to the mitigator,1
this is what the fuck generating temporary clas for storing some values what about using dict,1

i do not understand this why is the iner vector of what the fuck vector wtf vector t traceable,0
you did not ad here large docstring about what the hel is this and how to use it,1
it does lok like this has ben some activity around t lately so we wil likely be able to put an uper bound on this soner or later given that my inclination would be to kep the curent interface i e not split listhreadsforproces back out and do the piped shel comand regex logic to avoid puling 10kb it would likely be best to pul that logic into a separate helper function getpsoutputforo just to kep the rest of getpsoutput readable i do think that this is something that devil should know how to do as oposed to telemetry i strongly prefer that we have devil handle android version specific quirks,0
gento s python framework likes to use crap wrapers it might be posible to make it work but i do not know i would have to ask,1
ok chated in irc this is desired we want to kil the lop when you change the page,0
odfexport is a superset of odfimport so i would sugest not touching odfimport here and move al the test code to odfexport the only diference betwen the two suites is that import does import only while export does import export import as described in sw qa extras readme,0
crap wel at least we do not have a c 17 compiler yet,1

this case can certainly hapen if it is an abstract clas interface that have static fields loaded but not linked yet and gc hapens however in that case al static fields should just be nul so i gues it is a not real crash in production but it is beter to get rid of the asertion eror and skip some useles visits anyway,0
please ad newline after colon,0
should we just remove these two sections,0
the daemon should be responsible for exiting itself when the device goes away if you realy ned to rely on a signal then do it via a more reliable route like dbus or a named socket there is no guarante that the pid stored in this file matches the daemon and you are not just randomly kiling another proces in the system you also ned to consider the scenario that more than one usb device w this vid pid combo are pluged removed,0
fwiw al these elses should be removed,0
this is the only eror worth tracking al others mean dysfunctional logd if anything else hapens you are not geting through,0
why the hel does it extend jbuton,1
please do not ad more of those base typedefs they were a hack to work around broken old msvc versions that would not alow the derived clas to refer to that base clas by it is injected clas name implinheritancehelper but such hacks should no longer be necesary,0

ad a todo to use enableif to only conditionaly enable enums where there exists an actual implementation,0
puting it into dumpstate c or init rc would defeat the purpose of the change which is to alow the aplication caler of dumpstate or bugreport to chose whether the vibrator runs or not per diane s sugestion this wil go away in favor of a disable vibrator option that this code wil not ned to utilize,0
wel pointles is a bit strong a word i would rather have a log mesage saying unable to create conection object than a segfault at adres 0xblah,0

no vars are generaly bad i would sugest instead doing newline true,0
this file is included in a project that does not suport c 1 so the whole file must use nul instead of nulptr,0

this returns a buferedimage if we store it as buferedimage we can remove the ugly nuls from the getwidth and getheight cals,0
in principle yes but this is done by another clang tidy check we might want to run son as wel this check just does the dumb s iterator auto g replacement,0

i think that l just turn something horible into something horible and hard to read,1
sems that this should be in a utility for removing a child block,0

sneaky stupid bytearayoutputstream it might be les surprising if you just change the fields of interest to be public hide,1
you should just use a constant instead of math pow,0
s or or or damn,1
inline ifdefs are very ugly instead have a dumy function in the header that returns 0 and is a no op if no ifdef config qpu quiet stats the compiler wil optimize away the goto in this case and should even optimize away the extra cpuquiet unregister devices cal similar for other uses of the stats ifdef,1
i would opt for making entry struct entry union value basetype type and then kiling mtypes,0
useles so remove it,0
damn check should be is self args url and self is bundle wil fix,1
can we modify the generating script at 1 to not use a new year when it is executes and use a hardcoded year instead this creates unecesary difs or alternatively let us reproduce sh once on a precursor cl to make it easier to discern the changes that hapen because of the iron form element removal 1,0
i realize you may have no idea but why afaict the dbus use sync stuf should work fine on android and if you wanted to get fancy we have stdatomic h which is more portable and what the android specific crap got reimplemented in terms of anyway so you could cut out a midleman but i think the dbus use sync stuf should be fine,1
yeah people can also download it or build the rom on their on for other distros se the note below,0
i think this clas should be extending logedasyncextensionfunction similar to filemanagerprivatemountcrostinicontainerfunction just above,0
as you point out i am being overly anal fel fre to disregard,1

i wonder why we leave in rc2 that should probably be removed,0
we should indent these out to make it easier to read,0
this version is also anoying perhaps get rid of the output and only list the parameters,1
d oh in my head i was thinking it s best if this file remains corect but then it does not make a diference whether or not icu is in the list of shared libraries how stupid of me i wil remove it,0
nit loginbiguserview should only have one child so we do not realy ned to get index and insert at the index this could be simplified to delete public acount public acount nulptr adchildview auth user,0
this promotes bad behavior of caling mocked objects during the test preparation or asertion making it hard to use mock clients asert caled once with after this tl dr mocks are for the tested code to cal not for the test itself,0

agre wholeheartedly with fungi,0
both clang and gc are prety stupid about this warning struct fo emits warningeventualy this wil al be c and we wil just have real constructors but this wil do for now,1

these should be wraped in doubleticks build dir and local miror,0
yuk this should have used std auto lock,1
yay for proper inheritance like seing this sort of crap get removed,1
the idea is to kep as much code executing al the time as posible you are right that i could indent the entire block so it is under the if dedupe queue at the top of this finaly block but i was trying to avoid that,0

okay i wil remove them since the original code has it hesitated to remove it,0
it is crap we know it is crap but i would rather fix it on another pas it is to easy to clean things up and break the video and there are other fish that ned frying but that said i stil hate this giant struct mes and if i change it the giant struct is the first thing to go,1
oups that is sily it used to be a more complex lambda that got simplified thanks,0
drop the casting,0
done al these functional programing skils useles,0
yuck c may be nul here the npe wil be caught and loged causing a double eror mesage the second of which is misleading beter to return nul in the eror case above,1

you should resolve the erno import erno up top except socket eror as er loging eror eror s erno erorcode er erno,0
no i do not think that this is the case 1 this is a c file and we set brilo in libchrome s android mk 1 we should probably consider defining brilo system wide though building libraries with one set of defines and then including their headers with another is generaly an awful idea and build build config h curently checks for brilo as described above anyone who includes libchrome s headers without seting brilo might have a bad time i d advocate for defining brilo unconditionaly in build build config h to avoid this except that would break chrome os once it is building libchrome from the aosp repository se also the disgusting hacks i aded to base years ago to prevent ndebug mismatches baseinitlogingimpl built with ndebug and baseinitlogingimpl built without ndebug in loging h eventualy resulting in the cros debug eclas i think,0
it might be beter to kep a metrics member and use it throughout also this onetimeinit is a bit ugly,1
has lint gone mad single argument constructors should be marked explicit i am very explicitly constructing a copy here and an explicit copy constructor would be useles,0
what i failed to mention previously mixing in such pointles cosmetic changes is a por waste of reviewers time,0
wow dumb of me i loked at the mutex for the above stuf and somehow asumed it was geting unlocked in the block above yes this makes a lot of sense then if there is already an event in the fifo then it must be a wake event and we must be in the proces of waking up so keping the rest of the keys makes lots of sense,0
argh yeah in that case we would probably have to stuf the phys in the platdata which is also prety ugly i wil lok at this a litle more and se if we can do anything beter,1
please no underscores on options it is just fugly and confusing,1
drop this the libchrome ebuild eclas it,0
this is a raw string so that realy is a b c i was disapointed with how readable this turned out but it is even worse with regular strings,0
agred this is kind of ugly,1

we should kil the name blob it is not descriptive,0
could you try to use wtf forward h to avoid include wtfstring h in header file,0
hate to pis on your parade but this could do with a beter comit mesage tweak jit hotnes threshold or similar might be beter,1
for htperor you may want to parse the eror code it is quite comon to get 50 502 503 those erors should be retried,0
yeah forgot those are auto generated and thus idiot prof idiot,1

what kind of esoteric systems are you expecting this to run on sizeof char 8 is going to break far more than this litle daemon,0
it just so hapens that this dependency is only mostly dead the chromeos input method kcapslockey constant is used which ought to be removed in a separate cl,0
wel why do not you just use 0 instead of 0xf,0
same note as before about this patern if the read fails you are writing garbage to the register maybe we do not care but then checking the tcpc read result is not useful either,0
nit constexpr uint32 kidentitykeyflags,0
i hate that we have one giant file with exceptions like this would much prefer the module that throws it be the one that defines it but that is not an isue with the patch you are just folowing established conventions,0
done also decided to kil skipblocking for now since i did not realy like it is dual nature sek vs read i wil revisit this later if neded,0
handles are client local the client is geting destroyed the handles should to the underlying bufers wil be refcounted corectly theoreticaly you could cal handle put n times where n is the number of times your referenced it but that sems sily,0
yeah it suck ading a separate bufer would make al the reads awkward so i was sort of hoping that the os would save me and it is only for a couple lines of text initial response line and some response headers,1
you should normalize power role and data role ie power role,0
can you make a helper function for this part i e isprocesruning pid,0
we could avoid this test by defining a dumy neutron manager manager reset,0
idealy you would have die here but i gues context kind of trumps that,0
this schedulable is run before jayce dump the aded markers are not serializablemarker so they are ignored while writing jayce files,0
fixed must have screwed up something in my rebase,1
why remove al of these doxygen markers that were aded by some easyhack,0
the repeated seter loks ugly consider one masking step,1
remove wait for state idle init and wait for state ready init,0
ugh but it loks so sily done,1
src map nulptr,0
sory to be anal here but without an exception handler this wil warn but continue did not we want to exit if we canot determine the version idea a if unable to get version in get version display a log mesage saying unable to determine ovs version and return 0 b remove this else clause and let the comparison check,1
some pedant could tel that the line should not be touched damn pedant,1
is this even neded could you do invalid activeprinter printerpdpath,0
these pmu aces structs should be static,0
no the runtime should not depend on the compiler crap like the jit are a special case but if you ned this here then the enum neds to go into runtime,1
use die instead of echo exit,0
i think vblock is safely implied in these functions why do not we just cal them vb2 get keyblock vb2 get preamble vb2 get body ofset,0
typo setcon s tructedintesting,0
done this setup with flags geting changed in build cx1 tests cmake neds to be fixed soner rather than later it suck i wrote it and i already forgot to deal with it in this patch,1
why kil in this place we should replace below two lines with systemctl start mariadb,0
what hapens if it is 09 0 2 that is a valid ebuild name stupid but valid,1
for readability how about my pids checkoutput splitlines for pid in my pids,0
you might want to declare a clas to represent this table s entries to aces elements not through indices but through names would be much beter readable at least the meanings of the columns should be described beter in the coment block,0
dirname sems to work but i am marginaly hapy with the way the code turned out sems kind of ugly,1
is this realy necesary in general we prefer to use a timer that just starts counting from power on reset to aid with exact bot time measurements is there no timer like that on the rk328 if not you should probably define your own init function instead and cal that from botblock cpu init init timer is curently only caled from hardwaremain c which is in ramstage that s a litle stupid and probably left over from trying to ad arm suport into the old x86 only corebot we should refactor it eventualy but for now you wil have to hack around it,0
ad an ampersand so that the hyperlinking works e g rsparalelfor,0
ops yes this was dumb do not ned this macro at al ps2 fixes this,0
that is rather ugly legacy way to do it much beter to convert the osl fail below to sal warn which wil always use it is arguments even in non debug build and can also easily concat strings something like sal warn sw core blah exception e msg,1
i agre the indices are ugly but replace is not a public api,1
agred the curent solution with exposing onurlfetchcompleteinternal to tests is ugly this should be fixed on some other level,1
adesc aname adesc adescription,0
this should be the default you should not ned this if we ned to do anything we should do it in the codec not here we do not want to force people using the api to have to initialize a decryptor,0
should this test just be removed sems useles,0
same than alocrecordstacktracelement we were mising a destructor to delete the weak global for the type this should have hapened when disabling alocation tracking where we delete al alocrecord objects,0
useles copy,0
this condition is not suficient a cb pdu over umts could be anything from 7 bytes to 1252 as discused earlier we are mising a reliable way of determining the rat at this stage furthermore the ril spec says the data should be fixed size 8 bytes hence sugesting it should be in gsm format,0
this should probably be changed to c system same for cprintf,0
let us plan on doing this in a future change after the device specific policies are cleaned up is that ok with you,0
i think these should be string literals,0
subnet self make subnet fmt or self fmt,0
yep just like the health monitor controler you are realy into kiling bogons are not you i wil get it aded as i have done for the rest,0
child here should be a plain cb so bsl scopedcb output cb cb child,0
i would put a colon here and dito for the rest of the procedures,0
damn my bad focused on the other stuf,1
wow it suck that chromeautofilclient has to be the one to do this it does not realy sem like it is it is job on desktop the buble controler handles this can the android code figure this out itself,1
the character here is not necesary and cold potentialy because problems,0
are these placeholders for later i do not se them used beyond usage can you remove them or ad todo to explain the future use of experiment,0
oups i left garbage,1
dumb question since i have not realy payed close atention are these templates not used by eclipse or has eclipse ben taught how to use these new types of dependencies,0
i think i would cal this mdisplaylock since i think it is actualy trying to protect mdisplaydata i would also move this line up right above mdisplaydata and explain in the coment that it is protecting mdisplaydata from races betwen prepare and dump,0
i think we would want to pas in shadow frame getmethodadres or cal shadow frame setmethod later if the reason to pas in artmethod is that it may get moved in the future when we move methods,0
should be mfrefreshrate or mnrefreshrate,0
could we extract the interface and not have iner interfaces it makes the code using them verbose and obnoxious to read for no real benefit,0
i stil realy do not like kil being used here if u use u do not ned to do this and u can just cal stop on that,0
that whitespace is useles i think,0
sems like a prety crapy test to me p,1
kil the pading spaces,0
you do not ned the here you used as the delimiter alreadyput a die at the end,0
interesting does exit bypas atexit registered hoks i gues you do not get the dumps writen unles you explicitly cal lvm profile write file,0
modaldialogmanager takes care of dismising al dialog in destroy so i think we do not ned to do anything here,0
imo those kind of ifdef in board code are not teribly useful,0
in msm826 case audio platform wil be overide as msm8974,0
this is going to crash on many res txtatr because only 3 or so have pautoset 0,0
maybe can be concurent with other insert and remove executions,0
again this should only be executed if unit evaluation is on,0
aded the entry name first but in i felt puting it at the was realy ugly,0
not sure why this one is confusing it returns the list of files so it has to be imediate and it returns the files in that directory not ones in sub directories,0
cbuildbot chromiumos sdk would be the other big one,0
yeah i am an idiot i was comparing to the my workspace eventfilter which did not have your changes,0
please remove this solution should also be backwards compatible if the resource uri specifies the tenant id backward compatibility is not neded,0
i think cal graph stack makes me confusing they are two diferent things and here the size just means how much user stack do you want to dump,0
any reason this code is not preserving the slep umount while dieing we know the gvfs idiocy exists i do not se the cost in leaving in protective code in the die pathway,1
bad merge conflict fix i confes id idn t run pep8 before i pushed i fel into that trap,0
we do not usualy split a line up like this beter might be self mock get driver return value plugin driver agentbasedplugindriver self plugin instance dumy,0
put a todo dbrazdil here we should get rid of this,0
this is unecesarily exececuted if both mbnumeric and mbdatetime are false,0
yeah i did fel dirty my excuse is that i fel like we have got a deper problem with get tls everywhere we use get tls is a mes of casts i think we should change get tls to non volatile void then i think we would probably only ever ned one cast and no const casts,0
bin sh since you do not realy ned bash specific syntax,0
dirty to be fixed,1
this should probably print to stder if someone is parsing stdout to get the asignments this eror mesage wil break their script,0
ah i was stupid yes greater than is my recomendation,0
for next time we did ad a coment to the cutils include file a handful of basic atomic operations these are here for legacy reasons only avoid prefered alternatives use c c pthread locks mutexes whenever there is not a convincing reason to do otherwise note that very clever and complicated but corect lock fre code is often slower than using locks especialy where nontrivial data structures are involved c1 stdatomic h where suported c 1 std atomic t please stop reading here unles you are trying to understand or update old code sadly we did not have the bals to ad warning even ignoring vendor code there is a lot of code using this and it is also evil libutils twin,1
dumy,0
we are talking about the same thing the problem is that nova api client is not localizing exception mesages that is my understunding,0
i think this macro confuses more than it helps token concatenation is prety ugly,1
nit maybe put a newline before m modem gsm network reg status unknown,0
this is subclas of power test power test,0
max bin count 0,0
it is geting yuckier maybe we should refactor the native bridge interface stuf at some point,1
idiot forgot to upload idiot,1
oh i was wondering why you use ifneq local force static executable true below,0
this way that is stil under control of the user with the environment seting and it is reasonable to want an non paralel build but stil alow goroutines to hapen,0
this alocates a useles empty slice var cons console,0
typo irovic should be ironic,0
yes i want to remove the asyncompilejob before the promise gets resolved however therefore i have to kep the job alive somewhere after the job gets removed here,0
the non highbd named functions are only used in the highbd builds weird,0
it became ugly a couple of lines wil wrap if you ad just a few chars going from readable to not so readable,0
target ld tolchain prefix clang host exext,0
changed this an have funopen below,0
i gues it was retaliation for having me waste so much timeto figure out what that stupid construct was doing onlyto find out that it was just a convoluted way to do a trivialscalar type cast via a template no les,1
nit n after this to make it clear which dependency should be removed,0
frametime is int64 t which should be formated as prid64,0
this is kinda ugly why not mock out nodepolcmd and grab a copy of the pol object from there,1
sems like jack should be warning on these kind of bugs,0
iuc the 3 leter names for intel chips were because intel insisted on that if amd does not have similar sily pointles requirements we should use the proper readable names with projects the intel ones might as wel be random garbage at this point stnyridge is set in stone p because the git repo has ben created but loking forward cal it stonyridge or whatever next time,0
these nopcode have of course to be efacopcode then,0
you probably want self asertisnone p handle properties,0
the windows build gave me crap when i did not do this but i probably could have avoided it here,1
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha yaya gona use setimeout instead to cleanly triger finalizeframe,0
should we come back and make these libc fatal in another patch sems weird to say hey heap demonstrably corupt but i wil just cary on anyway,0
this stinks a bit making an asumption that secureblob derives from std vector uint8 t,1
here to find loaded library must return non nul or we would have failed earlier and reported the failure to find a dt neded library to the caler,0
drop the gitrepo import in your mocks below mock out revision control gitrepo instead of gitrepo,0
removed the file from the cl,0
nit using webviewscriptcomandtest webviewintest,0
mutating a field of something that is returned from a function sems icky i do not have a beter sugestion for you though,0
i think you probably want to pas both pid and tid in or the debuger request t,0
timeticks is esentialy an int64 you should pas it by value,0
caling this here is an ugly hack the isue is that the copy reducer pas runs after native context specialization runing the copy reducer early is problematic since we stil mutate the heap in many places for the same reason the serialize cal here might be problematic as wel,0
is this object created in constructor which case it could be reset god catch i acidentaly aded it to constructor while debuging i wanted it be lazy initialization there is a chance that developer is not using this api so no ned to have one,0
insert groundhog day meme even more since the lines are stil to damn long,1
checkpatch pl failure since this is a chery pick we have to ignore this,0
zaqar ui there is no ned to include a modulename here python py,0
i think we want config page ofset 0x80 and config vmsplit 2g y,0
why is this reimplementing stdlib h s div round up,0
loger h had to much interdependent incest with log h we merged them together and deprecated loger h i think everyone wil apreciate a one stop shop aproach to loging android log h c ndklog log h c vndk or systemandroid base loging h c bam,0
max days 0,0
sily nit i would prefer snapshot instead of snap,0
using and it neds a beter name e g like parsecompletecb,0
is not the db set up such that these deletes are not necesary i gues it does not hurt to be explicit about it here the waitforserverdeletion is necesary so we may as wel do that and an explicit db delete to,0
i think dex pc should be an operand to the hand hor ctors below,0
sugest prefix of upstream or backport to make it easier to know that we can throw this change away when we rebase also if posible please chery pick with chery pick x to indicate which upstream revision this was backported from,0
if you flushed in progresbar i think you should flush here as wel,0
unaryexpresion t u extends expresion t t eval u binaryexpresion t u v extends expresion t t eval u v,0
nul should never hapen so i would use preconditions checknotnul instead otherwise an misconfiguration in touch name to enum may be masked,0
damn you are right the suite scheduler uses the test names when puling results and job names are not a problem but the dashboard definitely uses this field fixed,1
huge nit maybe started vm q with cid d and pid d since most of the other log mesages are sentence esque,0
let us throw away this pointles indirection and just cal it a u32,0
e yuck only shared for the target only in static for the host,1
we should probably be using chrono instead of time t existing problem with other members to,0
optional you could also do match groupdict thus kiling the ned for the raw dif components variable up to you i could se benefits either way,0
i wil simply remove them and restore them when ready,0
we should realy be using the vibrator functions in libhardware legacy oh wel let us leave it alone for now maybe someday we wil have a proper vibrator hal,0
why this test if you dcheck type descriptor nulptr first unles the dcheck should be removed,0
style nit please use single quotes for string constants,0
the dumps are concurent in separate proceses we just handle the output from them serialy can you think of a beter name for this,0
aparently i am a liar i wrote a test to count the number of keys before any threads are created and after a thread is created and it is always the same i am not sure what caused the temporary extra one but i am a litle woried there is a race in the tests somewhere i suspect a previously failing test did not clean something up and i incorectly asociated that with a key per thread,0
why canot you unit test the parsing rather than having to go through the whole daemon,0
use mhandler removecalbacksandmesages nul instead,0
this method does a lot more than this description it would help to have some coments either here on inline regarding garbage colection worst ofenders region lock,0
remove waitable event h not neded anymore,0
dito user facing mesages should not use l,0
ugh that is an ugly api i did not realize there s a leak here std unique ptr or std vector char instead,1
end are not useful here,0
editedstyleitem item value instanceof editedstyleitem editedstyleitem value nul,0
so this ended up being a we bit ugly since we have to fake both the identity and the procesid via separate mechanisms,1
aware i changed this but in hindsight the valueror was stupid and would make invocations to the api anoying thus punted it,1
yeah i think this coment does not ad anything so i wil kil it,0
i would rather kep the coment changed to obsoletes language obsolete user malagasy plateau,0
use doins org chromium chaps conf die,0
i am not sure what the problem is exactly did not have time to run an experiment you disabled sanitization of sdk code last year in,0
stupid question how naive is this logic s concept of a day i e if the day has a leap second in which case the day wil be one second longer or rarely shorter wil this work corectly,0
these java util calendar objects sem somewhat pointles to me you could just use icu4j calendars throughout,0
i se your pain point now there is no acquire fence in thread2 to ensure the apearance order of key destructor stores i think it is to hairy now and let us make them seq cst,0
using unique ptr should not be aditional overhead i think,0
expand this docstring specificaly that your testing type gs path func implementation also parsecomandline and createparser do not ned to be separeate functions and realisticaly this should be a method on gspathtest,0
kiking is simple kiling of reaper thread and closing usb device endpoints,0
s anything outside no gurantes of for anything outside there are no guarantes about,0
ah right you could scopedfd release in that case that might sem more idiomatic than having two variables unfortunately there is the fstat yuck i do not like any of the choices,1
ah yes this suck we are going to grow the handles scopes proportional to the methods we are going to try to inline calin we ned a beter solution for handles scopes,1
this wil in general not sum to 10 total includes lots of other stuf c nice c iowait c irq c softirq c steal c guest c guestnice consider exposing them at least as other field,0
done as far as i can tel getjitoptions are always non nul,0
mypy types do not show up in the recipes generated markdown this project suports conversion to py3 anotations,0
remove both of these they are completely redundant,0
this is git being stupid it did not use the previous build id test for comparison but the with cache for some reason it marked the previous test as removed but in reality it is just a rename of the build id and a change of al references to the buildername in the file,1
can you alphabetize to make it easier to dif this vs brain,0
bordertype cv2,0
getlasteror wil be reset right after this cal as any winapi cal may kil it cache it is value before doing anything else,0
so this exists for non bridged cases it is an orthogonal seting so afaict your simplification breaks it i am not entirely sure that maters since i want to rework this whole space anyhow but i would like to avoid unecesary opses on the way,0
this cast jungle is ugly it can be rewriten as insertdeleteflags ntempflags nflags insertdeleteflags insertdeleteflags note insertdeleteflags adnotes i l do in an amended comit,1
weird i did this rm rf client git checkout client git rm client git comit and pof,0
this test is a horor show but it is temporary state until al v1 crap is deleted,1
is even numbered tokens wil be or so we drop them clearer,0
this static cast should not be necesary,0
we should make this more prominent that this cl is changing the semantics of version watermark based garbage colection,0
probably should remove this white space similarly for the other control files,0
stupid thing could you posibly do the equivalent of araysize minidumpsysteminfowriter 42 system info instead,1
blerg not sure i must have done some sort of copy and paste idiocy from a diferent comit version fixed this and the other instance i found of the same thing,0
that coment s obsolete now and should be removed,0
dcheck oat clas nul,0
kil empty this empty space,0
please kil return ok that does not realy match other kernel driver style just return 0 like every other driver does,0
mind caling this legacy mount point or something else if not file a bug and ad a tracking entry here about kiling this flag the name is to generic otherwise,0
the beauty of neutron comunity is that whatever you write you always get a bike shed coment if you do it the dumb way you get smth like last ip net last net version 4 sugested,0
should this be fprintf stder also i think we want to end the string with n,0
even though the old code had strncmp should not these be strcmp we do not want adb wait for sideload trailing crap,1

ok rob and betina should i remove you al as wel,0
it is true that it wil confuse the debuger but the biger isue is that it is violating the dwarf spec,0
this should be ok because the object is white can you run the tsan bot to be sure,0

this use of android log verbose is the inert level of enforcement todo consider implications of a runtime check of ro built type where user sets a default of android log debug or even android log info as per the discusion s incited during the botcamp talks on the new loger ghackman and others point out that some subsystems make al mesages android log eror the world has never ben capable of dealing with megalomaniacs or a jerk driving a bmw 7 series in the hov lane,1
i think string isempty is new in jdk 6 which means this wil not compile on jdk 5 you might ned to do libjavapackages length 0 instead or alternatively just replace the above logic with string libjavapackages nul when ading if libjavapackages nul libjavapackages libjavapackage else libjavapackages libjavapackages then there is no ned to nul it back out and besides you only end up with betwen the paths instead of having a useles one at the end,0
we may want to consolidate this with proces util linux c s subtractimespec and put them both together somewhere else in util but this is ok here at the point of use for now,0
what was the actual problem se wip dumy cpunitest with gb cpunitest use library objects vcl for a sucesful example of using that building it failed on al platforms with the forced cpunit fail in the test demonstrating that linking the test suceded on al platforms remember that you generaly ned to copy al the gb library setings relevant for linking from the library mk to the cpunitest mk,0
i do not think we should do this with upcoming changes to how the dp driver works we wil ned the bridge to be powered up here in order to do link training how concerning is the power spike timing violation,0
you can actualy pas nul as the second argument for some reason we have a lot of calers using dumy variables like this we should probably clean them up one day,0
some sort of sily typing or copy paste eror that i mised on final checking of the code thank you for fixing this to,0
ah damn got it removed this namespace from the header,1
oh whops max adr should be a uint64 t,0
you can combine these two makedirs into a single osutils safemakedirs,0

the coments in jnihelp h are a bit more vague not just for the mac unlike the art macros h as long as jnihelp h is paranoid enough to define temp failure retry scopedfd wil be just as paranoid and include jnihelp h,0
i would remove either mbuferwidth or mbufersize leaning towards removing mbuferwidth as width sounds weird to me for this purpose,0
we do not have procfs h on android if we ad it on bionic and platforms this hack and couple of others are not required it should be aded to old platforms as wel to remove these hacks completely note that glibc coment for procfs h says anyway the whole purpose of this file is for gdb and gdb only do not read to much into it do not use it for anything other than gdb unles you know what you are doing,0
it sems like the dumb method is useles in this test case,0
ugh this style convolutes changes in patches on per line is much nicer although i know this is the autotest style damn you mbligh heh and i gues gerit is also prety god at partial line changes,1
omit mesage in asertioneror except when it give some dynamic data to the user because it is useles if necesary put coment here,0
i am not clear on what is going to go in the else clause but is there a reason that len 1 neds to be a special case could you just iterate through vms,0
i think the checker should be aware of those ids sems sily to repeat them here this can be done in a next cl though,0
this method should not be herewhy are you not using resourcehelper resolvedrawable,0
fyi links like this can be turned into a shorter version and webrtc links to in that case the referenced bug has already ben verified should this todo be adresed or that bug re opened,0
instead of including this we should use services network public mojom tcp socket mojom h for mojom tcpconectedsocketptr,0
use cros build lib dieyou can give a nice eror mesage with that as wel rather than dying silently,0
loks like i mised this one sdkconstants fd resources,0
i realy realy realy hate the explictnes of this check mainly since it does not even validate that cros mark as stable actualy suports those arguments it s basicaly a dumb test it just verifies we do basic arg pasing if you can come up w something beter for this it would be apreciated as is tests like that is exactly what bit me in the as for patch unitest basicaly just verifying we are shufling args around not verifying it actualy works,1
if atmpstate astate then returnwhich means that when you hit the line atmpstate astateyou know that atmpstate is already astate which means that line is useles,0
you do not ned std because you already include stdef h,0
adcleanup should be used instead of teardown,0
i have the marginal preference of not using dst and src foranything else after they have ben casted to dst dm sec and src dm sec this wil make it easier in the future to eliminatethem and replace the char arguments with tbta dm sec,0
returns after system exit are weird you did not fancy a die string and die throwable or just leting the exceptions propagate,0
consider iterating over staticiparameters kproperties instead,0
runtimenabled contactsmanager,0
i know it suck buts let us rename this file so the e is lower case to match the other routers,1
oh darn those were for debuging only to build character and improve my morale now you know my secret,1
do we stil ned this the only thing runing nshlibsign is the ns ebuild at the very least change this to a symlink and stop modifying the for lop kil this of after the next major upgrade dosym shlibsign usr bin nshlibsign,0
perhaps in this case garbage colection is performed in the alocating thread,0
why should we probably stupid question but it might worth elaborating in the coment,0
nit argument can hapily sit on the same line func body usualy overflows to next line,0
you could convert the encodings here so getwcrashdirectory wil not be neded at al,0
this does not actualy work when caled at runtime because staticmethods have weird behavior fixing,0
darn i mesed up the alignment by 1 space,1
calback data useles coment does not tel me anything about how this member is being used please elaborate,0
neds stdef h for size t,0
oh i se we canot restorecon them because they are imediately unlinked after creation and we canot label them at creation time because they precede policy load the tmpfs chr file rules for dev nul in init fsck tolbox healthd and ueventd might be obsolete though due to the change to use sys fs selinux nul had not noticed that change to init,0
crap mised this coment il fix this in another cl,1
aded the mocks to the bug even though the mocks are only available on desktop and do not include managed prefs this change in particular wil make the experience on android consistent with what we have today on desktop the page is acesible but controls are disabled the specific change has ben recomended by rfeng our uxer,0
like this rk328 platform termination,0
this string sems a bit awkward have we run it by ux maybe reword as only one of your cards can be used on this device,0
the tostring ought to be redundant e name should be a string,0
should preface this dump w an explanation of what is actualy being dump think about multiple threads jobs going with intermixed output to the log,0
canot this be an arch specific library function i hate to se al these config arch ifdefs apearing everywhere,0
nit this kinda fels like an shost thing hot a host thing for example if there were an htphost we almost certainly would not expect it to automaticaly run within a bash shel environment if the user wanted that they would do something like sh c inline shel script i am not sure what the escaping behavior should be then fel fre to leave it here though,0

probably not i spent like a half an hour trying to get those generics to work but java generics are an awful hack if you lok into araylist implementation you wil se that they use object data to store elements as wel this is related to the fact that you canot do new v size in java when v is a template parameter,1

the 192 bit curve is very obscure nothing should be using it and i have never sen anything use it anywhere in general it should not be suported it wil be an ignored bug sanctuary however if it is required that we do not change that i can ad suport back in opensl make no mistake that it is a shit option though,1

yes checkpatch is a rather stupid style checker,1
this method is now useles i wil remove it in another cl,0
in the interest of ful disclosure it was pointed out to me by one of my standards comite coleagues that this is not guaranted to be the same type as int32 t even if both exist they are required to have the same size in that case since this would be stupid would result in at worst a compiled eror and we control the implementation i do not think it maters,0
style nitpick put the semicolon on it is own line so it is clear the lop has an empty body,0
oh sory i misunderstod i thought this was an unrelated bug that had just ben fixed in the same code now i get that this patch is actualy breaking it because a symbol is treated diferently from a constant stupid asembler wil fix,1
funy definition of shorter geting the human readable version is done to be consistent with other checks that not only print bah your instaled version suck but also being able to print we detected that you have version xy instaled but we ned at least version wz also your proposal fails short since not al versions of flex report the version as second field especialy those that are not suitable to build like 2 5 4 for example print flex version whatever version usr bin flex v cut d f2 sed s gversionalso while your sugestion works for something like flex where not much releases are expected it does not acount for increase decrease of the digits in the minor micro version partwhile 2 5 36 wil fulfil the test when shortened to 2536 and compared to 2535 a hypothetical version 2 6 1 wil be treated as 261 and thus fail the check if you only want one single comand and disregard storing the version for printing in the eror in case of failure to pas then one could use flex version awk split nf ver printf d 03d 03d ver 1 ver 2 ver 3 of to be shorter flex v awk but that is les readable and requires doubling of the brackets to satisfy autoconf quoting,1
i did not quite get why we are poping force modify locking here could you ad a coment here,0

there realy is not anyway to validate this in our setup nor is it posible to use a crap comit to test it doing so requires admin level aces to gerit what can be done i did skank the sql and test it against a gerit instance i ve got a vm localy for this sort of thing,1
i would prefer you catch the most specific thing s posible otherwise you start acidentaly catching acidental things in the future and it is hard to find the real bugs,0
yeah it suck i want to extend our gerit libs more at some point so this wil go away,1

what do you want me to do here and rest of the file btw i should do something to not make as many speling mistakes it is stupid to have to review for speling mistakes i wil se what my options are the least is to do one swep of code review myself on gerit before ading people,1

it loks like this is modeled on the incoming cal interception which honestly i hate there is no control over how diferent aps or visibility for the user into what is going on this is one of the reasons this kind of functionality has not ben introduced yet because just opening a flodgate of aps stomping on each other in a random order from a broadcast sems likely to leave us in a bad mes we ve already ben here with the media keys we have got yucky stuf from the outgoing cal stuf let us not do it any more i am starting to think that these kinds of facilities deserve some visibility in the setings ap where the user can se what aps are available for the feature and control which ones are used and their order,1
ugh i just loked at the shel scripts here and realized that this comand line is pasing clang flags as an argument yuck maybe this should not be using private c can we just define something diferent here that does not lok like you are actualy compiling as part of the actual build here that is where my mistake came from purely based on my existing knowledge of the build,1

ah this suck geting rid of the early return means neding an invalid state for asignmentlhsdata which means either ading an invalid state to asigntype which has to be checked in switch statements or alowing asignmentlhsdata to break it is preconditions e g default init to non property but with no expr i ve aded a new optional scope instead and instantiate it multiple times to kep the logic near the new register asignments wdyt,1
nit i think a coment here explaining what this header is used for and another one to explain what use rela means would be useful,0
s nulptr,0
now we should remove this because you removed buf type dmabuf,0
you should close chrome before caling setup case again also you technicaly do not ned to set the policies over again so it is posible to just cal create chrome twice instead not a big deal if that ends up being to ugly,1
desiredheap is a sily variable name this is the space containing the object nothing to do with desired or heap,1
do not use tempfile directly in chromite sources instead do a with block from chromite lib import osutilswith osutils tempdircontextmanager as tmp path blah,0
fortunately it is simpler because we do not even ned the keyblock flags for vbot2,0
ew yucky rather just put the new strings at the end of this file,1
i do not think these are used and could be removed but it is a handy coment to understand what the fuck is going on,1
undef undef quick entry point,0
dito here loking at the code it loks like it actualy causes the download to be skiped fro any already downloaded tarbals and just extracts them is the help text just of,0
this should be die or realy just take out the whole switch and asert bus 0 like in mtk spi init,0
i would also mention agety dmesg flock fsck getopt hexdump ionice loger there are also to a leser degre hwclock fdisk losetup mkfs swapon swapof some of these we wil probably want to refine in the future but this is a god starting point,0
haha yeah that would be an acidental untabing in vim i wil undo that hunk,0
dcheck kondemand,0
use shutil copytre symlinks false,0
yuck where is this list come from is there a smaler set like dumb or unset we could blacklist instead of whitelisting al these,1
ah darn yeah typec set input curent limit does not sem to do what i thought we can folow up with this in another patch since it wil require some more invasive changes,1
probably a dumb question why do not we have the rot ug id in these enewuser enewgroup for android rot,0
this plus the few bits below that ads viewport damage probably should be puled into hasdamage as wel i think,0
right ading child on dlopen wil lead to unwanted behaviour on dlclose,0
what are the dumy difs that show up in several files here are they end of line diferences if we svn export to mac os x or linux machines and upload to git we should end up with consistent line endings right lf not cr nor cr lf please check,0
why do we have a lop here should not this be just a single mipmap,0
curent formating loks ugly how about puling the code to a method then a method wil also prevent code duplication,0
drop the die,0
is opaque,0
i would leave these alone they are part of the original license and as ugly as they are not worth chasing them just to many cases to change,0
below you use art build path defined above sems like you should nuke it entirely or use it consistently,0
yes octal number suport is idiotic i did not make a general lint rule to flag this in java files because lint tends to only check android specific isues not general java isues and intelij already has an octal warning if i recal corectly it sems particularly likely to because problems here in build gradle since users are tempted to do things in version codes se the asociated isue,1
is not update status to string h kind of a narow name how about update status utils h i se you are ading the stringtoupdatestatus later p,0
i am considering moving the profiler into base or webkit comon so i am trying to avoid using what the fuck types,0
ugh i should probably stop using repo upload cbr re but the interface for ading reviewers on gerit suck,1
private methods ends with and if it is private it should be used outside the clas,0
i would name this default sesion json file template so people wil remember to give it an arg,0
hm okay fair point we should probably cal it fs then which is what linux uses for fs 1 although it loks teribly ugly,0
i think these two you want to live in platform src configure,0
yup lack of registers suck again i am trying to folow other examples in the kernel here i could store some registers in space in the data section but it might get ugly because i am not sure there is a god way to know the rp and rv do not conflict with the registers i have chosen it is just a bit of an awkward situation,1
do not get me wrong the practice of encapsulation makes sense if it was widely adopted for al config options and in a more abstracted way this loks like a sily alias that matches the exact config name what if we end up caling the config option universal physnet mtu the method is gona stink,1
the structure you described is not exactly what i meant to sugest here is more detail status edits s a z more sed comands here if csv then status edits status edits s fi sed status edits file that is stil not complete i think there l ned to be some other changes to acount for other diferences you may find it is convenient to write content to a temporary file take a lok at the mktemp comand,0
nit put it in c file like destructor,0
nit maybe mention that it is fine for latest log symlink to not exist,0
you already ad it to dirs below do you realy have to ad it here,0
does not mater realy since sdk instance wil get garbage colected so it wil get colected to,0
yeah i am stupid done,0
below you wil find some ways to solve some troubleshoting if you do not find a solution produce a report file using jack admin dump report and file a bug,0
yeah it is used by to share sha1 related constants yuck,1
in studio code we use asertions a lot asert blah nul,0
you already have mrs created for you so you do not ned another renderscript object,0
perhaps we should make them into instance fields since the style guide disalows static members with a non trivial destructor,0
this naming suck beter for test specs in test specs listor for test spec in test specs,1
i think this neds to become an aray of structs with each struct containing the struct s3c24x0 i2c periph id and anything else you ned,0
mark this as deprecated gut the function in favor of caling requestroutetohostadres casting the hostadres into a inetadres,0
er that should not exist we have cros build lib memoizedsinglecal already,0
clonegtrepo goes w in the try block else there is a race where hit right it leaves crap behind when it shouldn t also set wipe true herealso you are so fricking close to suport references here it is 5 lines or so part of the reason i think you should do it now is that the underlying patch fetch code is smart enough to skip the network unles necesary further if you did patch fetch original repo your new repo would have the sha1 but the original content would be stored in the referenced repo meaning no ned to fetch again on a subsequent run aka if the patching failed,1
gime a sec mark i am stuck in some crazy rebase hel,1
nit we only send down one rect why framerect s changed,0
should be a konstant,0
the nop functions are not necesary remove them though on second thought should we turn the amp of on suspend duno how this is suposed to work,0
up to novez does it make sense to pul in security and block this i do not realy think there is any security problem here,0
only if i ad some kind of helper method to do auto conversion to bol which would have the nasty side efect of alowing the enum values to be auto cast to int which kind of reduce the value of enum clas i t o type checking,0
maybe put a static asert here for kadrpthunksize 2 4u,0
just die,0
the false means nothing there should prob be bolean hascontentodisplay mydisplaysinglerot hasrotitem myitemstack size 1,0
that loks dangerous or useles either the pl is the curent system clock and this wil kil your system early or it is likely of at cold bot for jumping to rw firmware we might ned something like that but i doubt it is curently corect maybe just a bypas of the clock seting code,0
you do not ned the dieyou should also cal distutils src prepare after the patch,0
ah okay stupid tuple,1
may i sugest solum comon yamlutils for consistent behavior wrt load and dump,0
how where are client conecting permisions enforced in this daemon,0
and not caught by the upload scripts damn their eyes,1
and of course this should be interpreted in german as the dr freq the the i am not a murderer you know,0
since you use stevedore to load custom constraints this line is useles and should be removed,0
stupid eclipse,1
self display facade local facade factory localfacadefactory cr create display facade,0
you are screwed but e g bayou always limited it to 16 and i think that is entirely reasonable,1
se above or when jenkins kils it if something goes teribly wrong and it gets stuck,1
al these die can go away once you use eapi 4,0
any reason we are not using cgroups for this gerit might have launched subproceses so kiling it using sigkil is not going to be enough to guarante al the subproceses got kiled using cgroups would guarante that the kids get kiled,0
is not case insensitive so that is not an equivalent changewhile we are at it let us get rid of that ugly straircase efectalign al the pfont under the one on the if lineif pfont pfont pfont,0
you already have mongo conf group se 86 you ned to use mongo conf device path,0
what about caling getshortpathname longpath nul nul to get the length before we maloc,0
you do not have timeouts is this a stale coment,0
always inline or trust the compiler inline is mostly meaningles,0
wow there is no way to make this automatic sems like a pain in the as to recalculate every time we insert remove a buton,1
it is gerit suck at rendering monospace fonts,1
actualy there is no ned in knowing absolute path you have a pid after gdbserver is started and absolute path can be calculated using proc pid exe,0
note the daemon sufix is kinda redundant and unecesary,0
this should read cx cpflags cxflags c o,0
nit set rolback hapened to false and always cal getbolean with rolback hapened value getbolean wil not change the value of it is output if it returns false,0
sl oxcf ts number layers,0
i stil do not like this description p you are generating a sysrot that can be patched over extracted prebuilt package contents to create a complete sysrot,0
i hate al the wraping caused by using a name that long to my eye it makes the code realy hard to read i did it anyway though jerk,1
so this check is completely pointles,0
i was going to sugest removing the erno saving restoring because i do that in log but i just tested it and i did not do it corectly damn i should have writen a test for it,1
do not do this you spawned the proceses which means you have handles to the proceses kil them directly,0
get the status of slave builders to a master,0
hmph i am not sure why the f ing ide is ading them,1
just a sugestion you can kep it as it is since i do not se a big diference either way but i agre with the the aesthetic apeal of keping fields and their types together other than that i am not convinced i do not se why you ned to inspect this object at al i do not se the advantage of this over something as dumb as clas ntbparameters object def init self w length bm ntb formats suported self w length w length self bm ntb formats suported bm ntb formats suported clasmethod def get format string cls return hihih since you do not have a functions to automaticaly pack unpack this object i do not se why you ned to be able to aces the object atributes using strings so i do not understand why you ned to use inspect setatr,0
now you have sys types h kiling this and the blank line below would move us closer to upstream,0
this should be defined on the comand line upstream this is handled by handlelvmoptions cmake,0
use comandline optionparser,0
this is a replacement replace al instances of with a space this actualy is not that obscure it is more the escaping of via that is a bit fugly for future reference lok through man bash not meant as a rtfm it is one of the best shel resources i have sen also dash ing suck sems to be choking on it rewriting to use a while instead note normaly i would say put this in python but since this has to hit every single repo and neds to be reasonably fast james was complaining about foral the other day for example validly or otherwise i shoved it directly in,1
i was thinking that if we have the show function but return the after maping value say that 0 is writen in user space but we show the true register value 25 it is kind of confusing so i just get rid of the show function maybe we do a reverse maping to show the interval value if you think it is useful,0
i hoped to be able to output log mesages which is not posible at the moment it sems a bit cleaner to kil of your goroutines before faling of the end of main i am not sure whether go does anything there anyway i have removed for now,0
that change is also bad now you are not terminating the string so you can write gigabytes of trash to the scren,0
thank god this was not made public it is generaly quite useles,0
you right i just do not like unretained it loks like a bug i wil folow you,0
could be a plain imagerequest also update the name to thumbnail image request or similar,0
oatlastword is suposed to be the end of the oat content sems like that should move here or we do not ned oatbslastword,0
ops click here info reads prety awful dfixed,1
the developer should overide this in their mainboard kconfig for their fsp build not through menu config options this cluters up menuconfig,0
i would prefer it if we kept this instead do something like use clang use clang platform build ifeq use clang use clang false endif,0
erm nonsense i got confused by those long function names,0
nit since these are not exported i would recomend shorter end of line coments var shadowregexp regexp regexp matches a path var devregexp regexp regexp matches a path,0
wel if someone is comenting out a probe they could also coment out the comon data element but as i was implying in the above coment this was just a dirty hack my aim was to try to make dependencies explicit as oposed to the hiden dependency chain because by the memorize cals wil se what i can do btw is it safe to load ec and main fw in paralel how about both in paralel with touchpad,0
i could not manage to do that because there is no oat file during these tests,0
sizing info intrinsic sizing info,0
i think it is the default for the daemon if you do not use the setjvmarg it should not be neded,0
this one is fine to remove afaics,0
you know that had not even ocured to me but now i wants it p,0
are you sure this block of code should not be executed even if net ids is an empty set,0
remove the ifdef here,0
dump somewhere that this is a catch stack map,0
previously al stepruner implementations had to identify and specialy handle dumy steps like this now this case is explicitly covered via the run nop method,0
yeah i almost made the same coment only thing that held me back is that if anyone does screw this up it wil be realy hard to debug because the device wil rebot if init dies,1
note that i am not tempted to switch it to cat x while read because that would be a useles use of cat,0
done changed to warning aborting here sems a bit harsh,0
i do not think this works go wil garbage colect the slice ced you on an email asking about it edit aparently it works,0
this is incorect this function returns a tuple ugh loking at the calsites someone thought they were writing go and returned a tuple of result status pid or zero even beter it is writen in the stupid c style of 0 being suces could you tweak this to raise an exception on eror instead,1
remove newline,0
ned to return here since receiving bad mesage wil terminate the renderer and we should abort procesing the mesage any further,0
this loks seriously half ased if you do it do it right move al of it to avoid the aditional cal and throw the few exceptions by hand,0
initializing val 0 wil at least give you consistent data on a i2c read failure,0
only do this if data empty otherwise leave only one element in iov nobody has promised that data won t be nulptr if data is empty and if it s nulptr writev and equivalent don t promise not to blow up even if the size is 0 yes this is stupid yes it s a real concern now that s why al of the other writeobject implementations that you l find are careful to put this iov 1 busines in an if whatever empty iov push back construct,1
damn it i mised this bug in my review i wil submit a folow up,1
you can clean this up a bit if self join self timeout is none self p terminate if self join self timeout is none self p kil self join self timeout,0
yeah but we are al lazy wto busy trying to get stuf done to work out the minimal header we ned since 9 of folks shouldn t be using the hairy one it should have a name that says this is not the loging header you are loking for and idealy says to the 1 hey this is where the hairy stuf you are loking for lives,0
but i wil make this change right now so this at least stil compiles for other lp64 architectures even if it rejects every elf file at runtime because it is ignorant of their relocation types,0
put send onclosed flag in extensionmsg apwindowclosed and send it down to renderer,0
nit should we use kserviceworkerscriptmaxcacheage,0
is it not posible something like this try new bytestream suck is os true suck finaly is close,1
please intend properly here you wantif fo x y notif fo x y,0
dbg should be false to avoid log spew,0
please zero the structure before use this wil prevent many platform specfic nastines,1
stupid thing could you posibly do the equivalent of araysize minidumpsysteminfowriter 42 system info instead god idea but no minidump minidump system info writer c 19 17 eror static asert expresion is not an integral constant expresion static asert araysize reinterpret cast minidumpsysteminfowriter 42 system info cpu x86cpuinfo vendorid 3 minidump minidump system info writer c 19 27 note reinterpret cast is not alowed in a constant expresion static asert araysize reinterpret cast minidumpsysteminfowriter 42 system info cpu x86cpuinfo vendorid 3,1
what the heck is that reverse false and true,1
sily nit exists exist,0
which version of gsutil are you using not that it is an important field i just wanted to include them al for the sake of flexibility we can drop some if they are problematic,0
always redirect into tmp then mv f tmp otherwise the redirection creates the target even on failure,0
you must be transitively picking up string h,0
aha stupid me i wil use the structure directly thanks dale,0
oh this is for the host argh we ned to kil that to one day might be worth updating the coment in the meantime,1
yeah some rebasing stupidity on my part this stack does not ned to be on top of cron anyway reparented,0
if the background is just going to be white we should suet set self view backgroundcolor instead of ading another view,0
pythonic reduce indent by removing elses,0
you ned another pwr state idle or else when the batery is ful your leds wil do nothing in s3,0
this can be done by the transaction itself before caling resetpartialnetworktransaction doing so would avoid cyclic behavior and make this method clearer,0
i would prefer to remove these ivars and use setings directly if posible,0
i meant strcmp 0 you crazy c programers,1
put a coment explaining what these crazy regex s do,1
logevdev 0 important b c you want the last one to be the count,0
this code does not cal viewfortab as it neds a viewcontroler,0
those if s should also be shared in a comon header you can make e g bol functions isnarow isnormal iswide ismirored etc outa them,0
define s are generaly evil use constants instead which are closer to the c style const char kcmdstr cmd,0
can we cal this lan discovery false rpc server false,0
i agre in my opinion the coments on the fields in statskeys are redundant and we can just remove them i wil check with raphael since he is the original author of that clas,0
mis page up in col12 row02page dwn in col12 row05home in col12 row0end in col12 row04,0
can this be replaced by the below code wil pcm htimestamp return the pipe erors when suspended,0
erf templating codegenerator just suck so what about my first sugestion just put the labels in slowpathcode,1
god catch during my merge i brought the ad remove andstop butons back from the dead i have kiled those zombies,0
probably that was me being almost as stupid as the original code,1
i do not think goroutine is neded here you can just simply read the data from stdout of the subproces in case of timeout the proces should be kiled thanks to the goroutine in testexec cmd start and the input wil be terminated you can just returns the result,0
please kep these double they begin a doxygen coment,0
for dumb reasons related to the way gn analyze works this is neded and is right,0
i hate as imports since they make it harder to se what you have imported can we just say import state,1
this is realy col,0
awesome,0
shiny,0
nice bug how did this ever work,0
omg you are right removing now,0
dude your name goes first tim,0

it is a god point to raise but i think we are ok with this one in practice al of the close methods wil close whatever frame is outstanding on the stackok col,0
fantastic work,0
ha col,0
fantastic idea,0
this is fantastic,0
i am not sure how such problem are managed here on other projects we wil capture an outstanding to do ticket linking to comit lines of code as a reminder go is so col,0
oh right it wil be the clas name not the node name col,0
col tip,0
this is prety col,0
that is an excelent question,0
i did not know you could share the ipc namespace like this prety col 1,0
yep thats col,0
i love it,0

1 love it,0
gotcha perfect,0
the backslashes were perfectly indented before,0
it is perfectly normal for the exemplar timestamp to apear in the future relative to when the scrape started,0
wel swet,0
what is our strategy for docstrings for methods that are redundant with the super clas method,0
great,0
it is important that we are super clear about this when an integration is mixing both async and sync api,0
yup,0
great job,0
col catch sounds swet,0
swet trick,0
